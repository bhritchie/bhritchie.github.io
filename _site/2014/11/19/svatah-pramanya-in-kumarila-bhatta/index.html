  <span class="post-date">19 Nov 2014</span>
  <blockquote>
  <p><span class="abstract-label">Abstract</span>. <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kumaarila/">Kumārila Bhaṭṭa</a>, an influential Indian philosopher of the 8th century, argues that beliefs are <em>svataḥ prāmāṇya</em> (generally glossed as ‘intrinsically valid’). This has often been understood to mean, both clasically and by contemporary writers, to amount to the unpromising view that all beliefs are true, or alternatively that all beliefs are justified. I defend a more sympathetic interpretation according to which Kum=arila claims that beliefs are presumptively justified, the grounds for this claim being that other understandings of epistemic justification entail vicious justificatory regress.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-the-mmms-inquiry-into-dharma">Introduction: The Mīmāmsā Inquiry into Dharma</h2>

<p>The Pūrva Mīmāmsā was first of all a school of exegesis. The great bulk of their founding text—the <em>Mīmāmsā Sūtra</em>, set down in the 1st or 2nd century AD and credited to one Jaiminī—treats interpretative difficulties in the Vedas, discusses their study, and details rules for settling procedural questions regarding sacrificial ritual. But by the first century, the heyday of ritual was already long past, and there was much skepticism as to whether Mīmāmsā’s constitutive aim—according to <em>MS</em> I.i.1 the inquiry into <em>dharma</em>—was best pursued in the Mīmāmsā fashion. There were rival religious traditions: Buddhists and Jains, as well as the plainly nihilistic Cārvākas. And there were rival schools of Vedic exegesis, and many Hindus who, though acknowledging the authority of the Vedas, attributed them to gods—unlike the atheistic Mīmāmsākas, who claimed that the scriptures had simply always existed.</p>

<p>So it would have seemed appropriate to establish some philosophical foundation for the school. And indeed several epistemological theses are set out in the first chapter of the <em>Mīmāmsā Sūtra</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>MS</em> I.i.4. Perception is knowledge which one has by the senses coming in contact with the soul. It is not the cause of duty [<em>dharma</em>] by reason of acquiring knowledge of the thing existing.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indian texts are characteristically cryptic. Pithily rendered verses are meant to be committed to memory and elucidated orally by teachers, or studied with the aid of commentaries. And the <em>Mīmāmsā Sūtra</em> is difficult even by these standards. The verse is obviously invoking some psychological theory—though written around the 1st century, the <em>MS</em> codifies ideas of much great antiquity.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> But we must be satisfied—as Mīmāmsākas of later generations themselves had to be—with the text itself and the only slightly less difficult 5th-century commentary of Śābara.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the import of the verse is reasonably clear (and this will follow Śābara). For Mīmāmsākas, <em>dharma</em> concerns a causal system relating actions and future outcomes, so that to perceive <em>dharma</em> would be to perceive the future. And this verse points out that sense perception makes contact only with what exists in the present. So one cannot learn about <em>dharma</em> through perception (as the Buddha was purported to have done).</p>

<p>But, happily, <em>dharma</em> is attested to by the Vedas:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>MS</em> I.i.5. Certainly there is eternal connection between the word and its meaning; its knowledge is injunction; it is never erroneous in matters invisible; it is authoritative in the opinion of Bādarāyana<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> by reason of its not depending on others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is yet more puzzling than the previous verse, and Śābara offers little more than a paraphrase.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup> We seem to be presented with the claim that testimony (i.e. Vedic testimony) is infallible with regard to “matters invisible” (specifically <em>dharma</em>).<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup> The reason for this is, apparently, that Vedic testimony about <em>dharma</em> does not depend upon “others”: it does not ultimately rely on any of the other legitimate sources of knowledge catalogued by Śābara.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup> In other words, testimony, which in the ordinary case—and Mīmāmsā joins every other Indian school on this point—can only convey knowledge which was originally acquired in some other way, is, in the special case of <em>dharmic</em> knowledge, an infallible authority, precisely <em>because</em> no other means of acquiring knowledge will do the job. And thus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>MS</em> I.i.2. Duty is a purpose having injunction for its sole authority.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now we don’t have much idea how these ideas might have been fleshed out in the earlier centuries of the Mīmāmsā school. We ought also to allow for the distance between ourselves and these medieval atheistic scriptural exegetes who take the authorless but eternal and transcendent texts of the Hindu Vedas as the only possible authority for their ritualistic morality. (Though atheists do still walk among us.) We note in particular an astonishingly ‘atemporal’ Indian attitude towards literature in general. Thus</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>we can read thousands of pages of Sanskrit on any imaginable subject and not encounter a single passing reference to a historical person, place, or event—or at least to any that, historically speaking, matters.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">8</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The idea that language has a natural or eternal status seems indeed to have been anticipated in earlier grammatical texts.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">9</a></sup> The <em>Mīmāmsā Sūtra</em>’s bold epistemology of <em>dharma</em> is somewhat more intelligible given such facts and the attendant conceptions of the cosmos and our place therein.</p>

<p>Evidently this doesn’t vindicate Mīmāmsā epistemology. Nor were the philosophers of other Indian schools much impressed. There can still be little wonder, then, if even one of the most serious and sympathetic recent scholars of Indian philosophy has found in this aspect of Mīmāmsā “a kind of fundamentalism.”<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote">10</a></sup></p>

<p>Enter Kumārila Bhatta, a 7th century Mīmāmsāka. His <em>Ślokavārtika</em>, comprising well over three thousand verses, corresponds to just the first thirty-two verses of the <em>Mīmāmsā Sūtra</em>—i.e. those verses which had set out the philosophical basis of Mīmāmsā. In this paper we are primarily concerned with the second chapter of the <em>Ślokavārtika</em>—the <em>Codanāsūtra</em>, or chapter on injunction—which is framed as a commentary on <em>MS</em> I.i.2.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote">11</a></sup> Kumārila defends the authority of the Vedas on matters of <em>dharma</em> by way of a quite general epistemological thesis, the ‘<em>svatah prāmānya</em>,’ or ‘intrinsic validity’ thesis:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>CS</em> 47–8. The validity of all valid cognitions is to be understood as intrinsic, since a potency not existing intrinsically cannot be brought about by something else.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote">12</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kumārila is claiming that “cognition” (‘<em>jñāna</em>’ approximates to ‘occurrent judgment’) is (in some way) epistemically legitimate by default, or immediately. This will ultimately support the authority of the Vedas, since the ideas conveyed by Vedic testimony will also have immediate legitimacy.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote">13</a></sup> And there is no danger that anything will undermine this legitimacy, since in principle no other mode of knowledge acquisition (no other <em>pramāna</em>, in the Sanskrit terminology) provides knowledge of <em>dharma</em>.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote">14</a></sup></p>

<p>Given its role in Kumārila’s defense of Vedic authority, the doctrine of <em>svatah prāmāya</em> has understandably incurred suspicion. But, as John Taber has pointed out, the thesis doesn’t in its own right entail the authoritativeness of the Veda.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote">15</a></sup> That requires accepting the Vedas’ authorlessness, which demands a good deal of theorizing about language and the ontology of reference, the nature of the other <em>pramānas</em>, and so on; this is also Kumārila’s own understanding of the dialectical situation. So one could accept the Mīmāmsā school’s most general epistemological theses while rejecting Vedic authority. And I believe Taber is also right in arguing that, whatever its provenance, the <em>svatah prāmānya</em> thesis has merit.</p>

<p>I believe, though, that a satisfactory interpretation of Kumārila’s thesis has yet to be offered. In the next section, §[interpreting], I’ll explain why some prominent interpretations are inadequate, and identify some constraints for an adequate interpretation. In S[validity] I’ll develop my own interpretation, and in §[textualinterpretation] I do the exegetical work. Now as Taber says, the <em>svatah prāmānya</em> thesis <em>can</em> be considered independently of the matter of moral knowledge. II’ll do just that in §§[validity]–[textualinterpretation]. But to appreciate the theory’s merits and motives, it is necessary to discuss Kumārila’s epistemological motives more broadly, which I’ll do in §[conception]. In particular, we can understand Kumārila as attempting to reconcile a general epistemological theory with a moral epistemology, and as espousing a conception of knowledge that answers to practical as well as theoretical considerations.</p>

<h2 id="interpretative-approaches-and-contraints">Interpretative Approaches and Contraints</h2>

<p>Let us return to Kumārila’s thesis:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>CS</em> 47–8. The validity of all valid cognitions is to be understood as intrinsic, since a potency not existing intrinsically cannot be brought about by something else. And [in general] things depend on [other] causes in arising, but once they exist they exercise their functions by themselves.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote">16</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This tells us less than we might suppose. The commentarial nature of the Indian philosophical tradition means that conspicuous novelty is avoided. As such, all of the members of a given school will defend nominally the same answer to what is nominally a single question of inter-school interest. In fact different schools, and different writers within a school, may be answering different questions.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote">17</a></sup> Likewise nominally identical theses may not at all mean the same thing to different writers. The <em>svatah prāmānya</em> thesis is a case in point.</p>

<p>Every school had a position on whether <em>prāmānya</em> was <em>svatah</em> or <em>paratah</em> to cognition. In English this is often glossed as a question about whether the ‘truth’ or ‘validity’ (<em>prāmānya</em>) of a cognition is intrinsic (<em>svatah</em>) or rather extrinsic (<em>paratah</em>) to that cognition. A scholar will sometimes begin a survey by saying that the Nyāya school holds that truth is extrinsic to cognitions—where the Nyāya view is roughly that there is never a feature of a cognition which establishes that cognition’s accuracy—and then go on to explain how the Buddhists think that both truth <em>and</em> falsity are extrinsic to cognitions, even though that would be an absurdity on the Nyāya understanding of ‘truth.’ Buddhists can say that <em>prāmānya</em> and <em>aprāmānya</em> (‘invalidity’ or ‘falsity’) are both <em>paratah</em> because they have a quite different understanding of <em>prāmānya</em> in the first place.</p>

<p>Buddhists and Naiyāyikas are different enough that no-one is much confused about this, but Mīmāmsā is closer to Nyāya and less understood, and confusion about the meanings of theses is a real danger. That there is in fact little value in saying merely that the Mīmāmsā believe that <em>prāmānya</em> is <em>svatah</em> is brought out by the observation that there were plainly different understandings of the <em>svatah prāmāya</em> thesis in the different branches of Mīmāmsā, and even among Kumārila’s own later followers.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote">18</a></sup> Still less can the standard English gloss for the thesis—‘intrinsic validity’—be supposed to convey much about Kumārila’s position. (But this gloss for “the” Mīmāmsā thesis has a long history, and is well-represented in recent discussions of Kumārila, so it would be silly to coin a new phrase now.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote">19</a></sup>)</p>

<p>Nevertheless Kumārila’s reasoning in vv. 47–8 allows us to eliminate at least some possible readings of ‘validity.’ Validity, which is intrinsic, contrasts with invalidity, which is extrinsic. In the following verses, Kumārila supports these claims with a regress argument: if cognitions were not <em>intrinsically</em> valid, they would have to derive validity from further cognitions. Those other cognitions must themselves be valid if they are to help, but then, by the hypothesized extrinsic nature of validity, there would have to be yet further cognitions validating <em>them</em>, and so on <em>ad infinitem.</em><sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote">20</a></sup> Thus validity must be intrinsic. But while other cognitions cannot make a cognition valid, they <em>can</em> make it <em>invalid</em>, and hence invalidity is extrinsic.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote">21</a></sup> Now for Buddhist philosophers, the world is made up of fleeting particulars, and the association or categorization of these particulars which is found in thought is <em>ipso facto</em> a falsification. The notion of ‘validity’ on the Buddhist view, then, if it is to have utility, cannot be understood in terms of a correspondence between mind and world, but will rather be made out in pragmatic terms: a cognition is valid if the expectations it generates are not later frustrated. To say that validity is <em>svatah</em>—in some way internal to the cognition itself—rules out at least that view.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote">22</a></sup> But that doesn’t narrow the options enormously.</p>

<h3 id="validity-as-truth">Validity as truth</h3>

<p>A popular interpretation of Kumarila’s thesis has been this: cognitions are true unless shown otherwise.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote">23</a></sup> (Alternatively, validity may only <em>entail</em> truth.) K. K. Dixit, who adopts this interpretation, responds as one might then expect:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the difficulty with Kumārila’s argumentation is that a piece of cognition not proved to be invalid is not necessarily valid, it might be valid but it might as well be otherwise.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote">24</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That would indeed seem to settle the matter. But this is an uncharitable interpretation, and is anyway at odds with the text: Kumārila several times allows that a false cognition may be valid.<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote">25</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="validity-as-commitment">Validity as Commitment</h3>

<p>John Taber has defended another interpretation, the basic lines of which he attributes to Pārthasārathimiśra, another Mīmāmsā commentator.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote">26</a></sup> According to Taber, validity is not truth but rather as it were <em>commitment:</em> “every cognition is accompanied by an initial sense of conviction; one is initially inclined to believe of every cognition that it is true.”<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote">27</a></sup> But Taber rightly allows that Kumārila is concerned not only with psychology but also with what is <em>reasonable</em>. Verse 60 tells us that when a cognition is not undermined, then “there is no reasonable ground for doubt.”<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote">28</a></sup> So we are supposed to be <em>right</em> in accepting our beliefs as a guide to how things actually are. Taber incorporates this point into his interpretation as follows.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One continues to be so inclined as long as the cognition is not called into question. Almost certainly, however, if the cognition is never overturned, it <em>is</em> true. Falsehood cannot conceal itself forever. If, over the long run, the cognition is not shown to be false, then on the basis of its initial, intrinsic validity one is certainly <em>justified</em> in believing that it is not false, that it is really true.<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote">29</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, for Taber, shows Kumārila adopting a kind of hard-headed empiricism: one may believe only that for which one has evidence; but, in addition, to have <em>no</em> evidence for something (to have no evidence that your view is wrong, for example) is to be warranted in thinking that no such evidence exists.<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote">30</a></sup> To ask for more is in any case futile, since the demand only leads to regress.</p>

<p>Taber’s is one of the most sympathetic and careful interpretations of Kumārila on intrinsic validity, and there is much to like about it. But how can we take seriously the idea that a cognition never undermined is “almost certainly” true, a view that Taber says is “common sense”? Dixit’s comment is again apt: it might be true and then again it might not. Suppose, for instance, that, from a distance, I mistake for a woman a man whom I am unlikely to encounter again, and would not recognize if I did. The passage of time is unlikely to expose my error. This will often be a problem in practical life as well: it is often hard to know whether one has acted well. I could not possibly have a general expectation that advice—to buy fair-trade coffee, say—will, if bad, always, or almost always, ultimately be recognized as such. Taber himself actually raises roughly the same worry about Kumrila’s defense of the Vedas, namely that they seem to come out unscathed only by default.<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote">31</a></sup> But he seems to think that the worry is largely <em>restricted</em> to the Vedic case, which, as my examples show, is not the case.</p>

<p>The difficulty here is particularly acute for Taber because, although in vv. 47–8 Kumārila says that the validity of <em>valid</em> cognitions is intrinsic, Taber’s view that <em>all</em> cognitions are intrinsically valid, at least initially. This creates the impression that <em>every judgement</em> has <em>prima facie</em> justification or warrant. There is no good reason, on this view, why just any judgment should not be warranted, even if it’s formed on the basis of a dream or wishful thinking. Taber may say that Kumārila’s defense of the Vedas is unsuccessful because it makes Vedic injunctions valid just by default, but really that’s tantamount to an objection to the <em>svatah prāmānya</em> thesis itself, on Taber’s interpretation thereof. The whole <em>point</em> would be to make cognitions justified by default, despite the fact that many types and instances of judgements—including quite empirical judgements—cannot be supposed likely to be corrected if faulty.<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote">32</a></sup></p>

<p>Taber’s interpretation draws attention to crucial but often overlooked features of Kumārila’s epistemology, including the lack of coincidence between truth and validity and the importance of warrant or justification. But Taber does not explain how warrant enters the picture; the interpretation falls into the same trap that Pārthasārathi’s does, and which other scholars have noted in that context: the theory reduces to a theory of judgement.<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote">33</a></sup> Taber has provided an argument for his claim that a cognition “compels our assent”<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote">34</a></sup> only if that means merely that judgment <em>entails</em> assent. We are offered no reason to suppose that it would be unreasonable to stop believing something upon realizing that one does in fact believe it, if one cannot then adduce some evidence for it. But Kumārila explicitly draws the conclusion that this <em>is</em> unreasonable.<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote">35</a></sup></p>

<p>Moreover, while Taber is right to say that the <em>svatah prāmāya</em> thesis is separable from the doctrine of Vedic authority, the thesis is plainly motivated in great part by a desire to defend the possibility of Vedic (or ‘moral’ or ‘practical’) knowledge. Even if there are independent arguments—from the threat of regress, most obviously—it does not seem to me that we do Kumārila’s view much of a service if the realm of knowledge of most interest to him fares particularly poorly on his own epistemological theory.<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote">36</a></sup> Besides which, it is hard to imagine that Kumārila would rest his thesis on the idea that the passage of time makes a judgement more likely to be correct when this line of thought so clearly could not, <em>in principle</em>, apply to the Vedic case, and which, indeed, would make validity <em>extrinsic</em> in an obvious sense, since it would accrue with time. But Taber’s interpretation relies on this claim, for which the textual evidence is ambiguous at best.<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote">37</a></sup></p>

<p>Two further points, besides those to which Taber draws attention, will help in constructing a better interpretation. The first stems from a bit of a puzzle. As noted, it seems that, on Taber’s interpretation, any judgement or belief whatever is supposed to be possessed of validity. He insists that <em>all</em> cognitions are valid, unless sublated or otherwise brought into doubt by some further cognition—at which point they are not really cognitions anymore at all, because they have been abandoned psychologically. And that is a common reading of Kumārila. But the Mīmāmsās, like other schools, provide a list of the sources of knowledge or valid cognition—for the Mīmāmsās the list includes, among other things, perception, inference, and testimony.<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote">38</a></sup> But what would be the need for such a list if every cognition is automatically valid?</p>

<p>In fact Kumārila does <em>not</em> think that every cognition is valid—mere fancies or wishful thoughts, for example, are not valid.<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote">39</a></sup> Kumārila also notably excludes memorial judgements from the realm of validity—only cognitions or judgments with novel contents are apt for validity.<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote">40</a></sup> And although memories are, on Kumārila’s view, generally recognizable as such, it isn’t <em>always</em> obvious whether a judgment is memorial, since on the <em>Mīmāsā</em> view mistaken judgements—formed, say, in a dream—<em>are</em> effectively memorial events or collocations of memorial elements. So we cannot say that every judgement has intrinsic validity, or that any commitment we have is warranted barring some counter-indication. In which case we’ll need to find a way to understand how cognitions can be <em>intrinsically</em> valid without severing the connection between <em>valid sources of cognitions</em> and <em>valid cognitions</em>.</p>

<p>The second point is this. The Mīmāmsās are strict about distinguishing the mental state which provides some awareness of the world (I will call this a first-order cognition) from the mental state which provides awareness of that first-order cognition (I’ll call this a second-order cognition).<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote">41</a></sup> Some Indian schools are in accord with Descartes: a cognition is itself present to consciousness as it reveals its object. Not so Mīmāmsā.<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote">42</a></sup> But the implications of this point for the <em>svatah prāmānya</em> thesis have not been properly appreciated. In effect, we have <em>two</em> theses.<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote">43</a></sup> One thesis concerns the status of the first-order cognition, and the second concerns the apprehension of that status by a second-order cognition. It may then be, for example, that only some cognitions <em>are</em> valid, but that every cognition, when apprehended, is <em>taken to be</em> valid.</p>

<p>In my view the failure to appreciate this second point is partly responsible for the failure to appreciate the first. Tara Chatterjea, for example, though observing that the <em>svatah prāmāya</em> thesis is really two theses, says that Kumārila makes “contradictory suggestions” concerning the scope of the <em>svatah prāmāya</em> thesis, and identifies v. 53 as apparently claiming that <em>all</em> cognitions are intrinsically valid, in contrast with e.g. v.47 which says only that <em>valid</em> cognitions are intrinsically valid.<sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote">44</a></sup> (Taber also relies on v. 53 in claiming that all cognitions are valid.<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote">45</a></sup>) But if v. 47 concerns the status of a cognition while v. 53 concerns the <em>assessement of</em> the status of a cognition, then that is too quick. We may thus hope that care regarding these two points will make an adequate interpretation possible.</p>

<h2 id="a-new-interpretation-of-kumrilas-intrinsic-validity">A New Interpretation of Kumārila’s Intrinsic Validity</h2>

<p>Since the <em>Codanāsūtra</em> is dense and difficult, I begin by describing my interpretation of Kumārila’s <em>svatah</em> <em>prāmāya</em> thesis in general terms. Then, interpretation in hand, I’ll take up exegesis in §[textualinterpretation].</p>

<p>‘Validity’ has, for Kumārila, as for most Indian philosophers, both a causal (or psychological) aspect and also a normative aspect; in India, as in the West, different understandings of perception were taken to have implications for what we can know, and epistemological commitments motivated views about mind and perception.</p>

<p>Beginning with the psychological side, consider the idea, common in the history of philosophy, that experience confronts us with certain <em>appearances</em> or <em>ideas</em> or <em>impressions</em> (though these appearances need not always be pictorial or visual in nature). One may hope that these appearances at least sometimes resemble or represent the world in some way. Locke, for example, thought that they sometimes did, and that we could sometimes be confident of this; the Stoics had a comparable view. Certain ancient skeptics thought that indeed our impressions <em>might</em> resemble or represent the world, but they argued that we can never know whether—and should not believe that—they do. Hume and Kant, in different ways, decided that the whole question was nonsense. Parallel positions existed in India concerning what we have called ‘cognitions.’ As in the early modern case, skepticism was more threat than reality, but Locke, Hume and Kant have their counterparts among Naiyāyikas, Buddhists, and idealists. And, as a start, we can think of Indian cognitions as being roughly equivalent to the West’s appearances or impressions.</p>

<p>One might think of cognitions or appearances as offering themselves for either acceptance or rejection. This is the view of some of Kumārila’s opponents—hence an objection considered by Kumārila to the effect that cognitions do not present themselves as authoritative.<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote">46</a></sup> For Kumārila himself, on the other hand, a cognition does not simply present the cognizer with a view or thought which he might, but equally well might not, accept as his own. For Kumārila, to form a cognition is, as Taber says, already to view the world in the way portrayed by the cognition.<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote">47</a></sup></p>

<p>In Kumārila’s case, the language of ‘appearance’ may in fact easily mislead. Taber employs such language too uncritically when he sees in Kumārila “a kind of rigid philosophical realism which insists strictly on the reality of appearances,” and when he says that the “emphasis on the inability to distinguish true from false cognitions expresses what seems an almost skeptical attitude on the part of Kumārila, viz., that we can never establish with absolute certainty that a cognition corresponds with reality.”<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote">48</a></sup> This suggests that we stand back from, or in judgment of, cognitions, which Kumāriladoes not think is the normal case. It’s not so much that skeptical questions can’t be settled as that they don’t arise, precisely because, for Kumārila—and this much is uncontroversial—our cognitions just constitute the way we see things without any prior need for the passing of evidential judgments.</p>

<p>Consider on the one hand a (representational) painting. One may appreciate it without supposing that what is represented there ever existed elsewhere. For most of us, on the other hand, a photograph or recording invites us to suppose that we are getting a bit of a glimpse of another time and place. Only when something seems off about the photograph do we feel the need to inspect it more carefully—when what is displayed seems very improbable, say, or when a face on the cover of a magazine is suspiciously free of wrinkles. But Kumārila’s cognitions are not like paintings <em>or</em> photographs. A photograph, like a painting, is something which stands apart from own way of seeing things, and Kumārila does not believe cognitions are like that. A better analogy for Kumārila’s cognitions would be a (very clean) window. One may realize that there is a window at the end of a hall because one has already seen through it to the trees beyond. If one realizes that there is a window, that is only because one has already looked through it. Likwise, the existence of a cognition is inferred from what is shown us by it, once we have already adopted it as part of our thinking.<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote">49</a></sup></p>

<p>It was noted earlier that the ‘intrinsic validity’ thesis is really <em>two</em> theses, one about a first-order cognition and one about a second-order cognition. There are likewise two aspects of the thesis still considered as a psychological thesis, and we are now in a position to articulate these.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ψα: Cognitions are transparent.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ψβ: The existence of a cognition is inferred.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, as regards the first-order cognition, the claim (Ψα) is that it is the nature of cognitions to provide a window on the world, rather than a picture of it—to have a cognition just is, at least in the basic case, to have a view of the world. Regarding the second-order case, the point (Ψβ) is that one reads the existence of the first-order cognition off of the portion of the world thus revealed (you see the trees through the window, and because you can see trees you may infer that there is a window). The first-order cognition does not become an object of thought directly; it can be contemplated, indirectly as it were, without stepping back from the cognition or regarding it as something now in question, or as something which might now be rejected, since it is the very having of the view that makes it possible to recognize the cognition.<sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote">50</a></sup></p>

<p>Kumārila also claims that <em>invalidity</em> is <em>extrinsic</em> (<em>parata</em>). If cognitions manifest the world rather than representing it, Kumārila nevertheless thinks that cognitions may err in various ways. We might again compare a window, which, even if clean and without impurities—so that we cannot inspect it directly—may yet be warped or tinted so that although we see the world through it and not in it, we see the world through it <em>wrongly</em>. The thesis that invalidity is extrinsic emphasizes the point that even when a cognition portrays the world wrongly, we cannot consider it directly and note features of that cognition that are misleading, the way you could point out parts of a photo that may mislead. What you can do is form new cognitions, which may reveal that earlier cognitions were defective. Kumārila identifies two cases. First there is the case where you directly apprehend something as being different than you had thought: this is like looking out of a different window, seeing that it’s bright outside, and realizing that the first window had been tinted. Second there is the case where you realize that the first cognition was formed in some defective way: this is like being told that the windows are tinted and realizing that it must then be brighter out than you thought.<sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote">51</a></sup></p>

<p>The extrinsic invalidity thesis, regarded as a psychological thesis, may thus again be divided into two parts, corresponding to the first- and second-order cases respectively.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ψα-: Cognitions do not contain signs of their own defeciencies.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ψβ-: One can only appreciate the deficiencies of a cognition through a further cognition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first thesis is that there is nothing in a cognition itself which could indicate a problem with it—a problem can only be indicated by another cognition, or by something turned up by another cognition (either because it reveals the world differently or because it reveals that the first cognition was formed in a problematic way). And second, for the very same reason, one can only <em>recognize</em> a problem with a cognition on the basis of what is turned up by some further cognition. The difference between the two cases is that, in the first case, one might never even notice that one had possessed a cognition that was problematic: one might adopt a new view without ever noticing an evolution in one’s thinking, or one might wind up holding inconsistent views (i.e. one might retain the original view). In the second case, by contrast, the original cognition is <em>seen</em> to be defective. To see the old cognition as defective (as invalid) is already to have set it aside, and the new cognition which revealed the defectiveness of the first has thus become your new way of seeing the world.</p>

<p>Kumārila sometimes appeals to the fact that a cognition is present and manifesting the world in a certain way as a reason for saying that cognitions are intrinsically valid.<sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote">52</a></sup> But Kumārila also says that even invalid cognitions can manifest the world, at least until the error is noticed.<sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote">53</a></sup> This point seems to have been overlooked (i.e. by interpreters who think that <em>all</em> cognitions are—at least initially—valid) primarily on account of a failure to distinguish the first- and second-order cases.<sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote">54</a></sup> Kumārila also assumes that once an error has been acknowledged, the erroneous cognition is set aside; thus a cognition will manifest the world in a certain way until it is recognized to be invalid. Thus again it has been supposed that validity and manifestation go hand in hand. But again this conflates the first- and second-order theses. A cognition could continue to manifest the world a certain way even after its invalidity has been revealed, if that invalidity has not been noticed (in the same way that you can learn something new without realizing that it undermines something else you believe). And there is another way that manifestation may come apart from validity. It is only cognitions derived from certain sources that can be valid: in particular valid cognitions derive from valid modes of knowledge. But you could see the world some way without having a view that is even apt for validity. (Memorial beliefs, for example, are not validity-apt.<sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote">55</a></sup>) A cognition is intrinsically valid, then, neither in virtue of being accurate nor in virtue of manifesting (or pretending to manifest) the world. A cognition is intrinsically valid when it constitutes a genuine (though perhaps distorted) window on the world, in virtue of having a psychological or causal basis which allows it to be such a window. Cognitions arising from another source, however much they present or seem to present the world, and however accurately they do so, are not and cannot be valid, intrinsically or otherwise.</p>

<p>Although Kumārila generally describes cognitions and validity in psychological or causal terms, he takes his account to have (what we would consider to be) normative implications, and we can consider Kumārila’s thesis to have a normative or evaluative aspect.<sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote">56</a></sup></p>

<p>On the normative side, we may understand validity as the status a cognition has when one is rationally entitled to it: I’ll call it ‘warrant’ or ‘entitlement.’ Once again there are two theses here, corresponding to the first- and second-order cases.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Φα: A cognition’s warrant does not depend on other cognitions.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Φβ: Seeing a cognition as warranted does not require seeing it as supported by other cognitions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the first-order case, the claim (Φα) is that the warrant of a cognition does not depend on its being buttressed by further cognitions. (Thus, for example, if you read in the <em>Times</em> that Hirut is beautiful, and come to believe that Hirut is beautiful, this belief does not require, for its warrant, that you have any other supporting belief—that the <em>Times</em> is a reliable source, say.) Second (Φβ), one may realize that one possesses no evidence (or no further supporting beliefs) for some belief without being rationally required to suspend or abandon that belief. Indeed, barring undermining evidence, it is irrational to reject your beliefs. (So, for example, suppose you realize that you believe Hirut is beautiful, but can’t remember how it is that you came by that belief. If you’re reasonable, and barring some more definite source of doubt, you will stand by this belief regardless.)</p>

<p>To say that invalidity is extrinsic again means two things.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Φα-: a warranted cognition loses that warrant when some further cognition undermines it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, for example, the belief that Hirut is beautiful will lose its warrant if you read that the reporter has been fabricating stories.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Φβ-: A cognition is properly judged unwarranted when it is seen to be undermined.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, if you realize that the reporter discovered to have been fabricating stories is the reporter who wrote about the beautiful Hirut, then you will properly see the belief you had about the beautiful Hirut as unwarranted.</p>

<p>A cognition is not simply warranted by default. The warrant of a <em>warranted</em> cognition is intrinsic in the sense described. But to have that status in the first place depends on the causal or psychological origin of the cognition. Hence the list of ‘valid’ <em>sources</em> of cognition, or of warrant-grounding sources of cognition. Thus a cognition arrived at through testimony, inference, perception, or other sound basis of knowledge is warranted—though it may not be <em>correct</em>, since not every belief derived from perception (say) is in fact veridical. A cognition originating merely in a dream or wishful thinking was never even warranted in the first place, though it may very well masquerade as a valid cognition, and as a cognition from a good source.</p>

<p>How are the psychological and the normative aspects of <em>svatah prāmānya</em> related? In Kumārila’s view, the various <em>pramānas</em> are ways of opening up windows (in the form of cognitions) on the world. They don’t represent it but rather reveal it. This is what distinguishes the <em>pramānas</em> from other sources of cognition such as wishful thinking or dreams—and even, in Kumārila’s view, from memory, which is parasitic on genuine <em>pramānas</em>. And if this is how <em>pramānas</em> work, it would be a mistake to distance yourself from your cognitions, as if they merely represented the world, or as if in looking around your surroundings you were only looking at something in your own head. A confused philosophical perspective on these matters leads to skepticism—it did so, or was thought to, in India as in the West—and a clear view ought to ward off that skepticism. Now of course sometimes we’re wrong about things—Kumārila doesn’t pretend otherwise. One often learns this in the ordinary course of things, as when one gets a closer view or a view in better light. But it is because cognitions open up the world to us the way they do that we can correct ourselves in that manner.<sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote">57</a></sup></p>

<p>Kumārila’s claim that cognitions are grasped as valid—the second-order intrinsic validity thesis—may give the impression that Kumārila is trying to help himself to evidence. But we can now see that grasping a cognition as being valid corresponds more closely to <em>reasonably believing something in a self-aware and occurrent manner</em> than it does to <em>believing that a belief is reasonable.</em> The latter—believing that a belief is reasonable—looks like it ought generally to be a response to some kind of evidence one can marshall regarding the belief in question (or its content). But that kind of reflective attention involved in <em>evaluating</em> a belief is different from the reflective attention involved in simply <em>exploring</em> one’s beliefs. Consider the familiar idea that, in order to figure out what one believes, one looks not inward but rather <em>outward</em> towards the world—or the world as one sees it. Suppose I’ve seen Hirut, and I’m asked at some later point whether she is beautiful (or whether I believe that she is). I’ll think back to what she looked like, or try to frame her image in my mind, and then say “yes” or “no” depending on what I see there. There need be no question in this case of assessing evidence in any ordinary sense. I’m not going to review the visual conditions in which I first saw her, or anything like that. This is the case Kumārila is concerned with (and which he thinks is the normal case). And Kumārila’s claim then seems fair. This kind of reflection just assumes the reasonableness of the original belief, and it’s hard to see how else it could be. In Kumārila’s view there is no need to be concerned with the further question about the basis of one’s beliefs, so far as no particular cause for concern arises; indeed, if there were such cause for concern, you could never answer this simple question about whether Hirut is beautiful: the moment you thought back on Hirut your earlier cognition of her would have to be in doubt. Compare J. L. Austin on demanding how one knows:</p>

<p>If you say ‘That’s not enough’, then you must have in mind some more or less definite lack. ‘To be a goldfinch, besides having a red head it must also have the characteristic eye-markings’: or ‘How do you know it isn’t a woodpecker? Woodpeckers have red heads too’. If there is no definite lack, which you are at least prepared to specify on being pressed, then it’s silly (outrageous) just to go on saying ‘That’s not enough’.<sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote">58</a></sup></p>

<p>That also helps us to make sense of the idea that <em>all</em> cognitions may be taken as valid just in virtue of being cognitions. Sure enough, not every cognition <em>is</em> valid. But accepting it as valid doesn’t <em>make</em> it valid, either: Kumārila does not think that reflection renders a cognition valid any more than it renders cognition invalid, and neither does taking a cognition to be valid in any way establish that it is valid, or even imply that any evidence favors that cognition (unless such evidence as is manifested in that cognition already). It does not mean that warrant or evidence has <em>accrued</em>. To put the point differently, we might say that Kumārila is interested rather in <em>being</em> justified than in <em>having</em> a justification.</p>

<p>Again, Kumārila’s view is that reasonable belief does not <em>require</em> inquiry into evidence; it is no part of his view that there is anything <em>wrong</em> with such inquiry. We saw above that Taber attributed to Kumārila the idea that if no contrary evidence comes up then there must not be any. But whether or not that is Kumārila’s view, it is not part of the present doctrine. There is thus no willful blindness in this approach, though the Mīmāmsās’ larger aim of defending Vedic authority may create that impression. Kumārila’s view is not that testimony (for instance) ought always to be accepted unquestioningly. There are lots of reasons why one might distrust any given testimony, and likewise for other cognition-forming mechanisms. It is only that Kumārila gives no ground to skepticism. The fact is that quite often we know or can easily know plenty about the various ways we form our beliefs and about when further investigation is required.</p>

<h2 id="exegesis">Exegesis</h2>

<p>As noted, the <em>CS</em> is a commentary on <em>MS</em> I.i.2, which says that “duty is a purpose having injunction for its sole authority.” A number of the initial verses of the <em>CS</em> are concerned with minor clarifications of that thesis, but vv. 5–6 are close to a statement of the chapter’s main theses:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>5. Inasmuch as authoritative character [regarding duty] is possible only to the Word, [Śābara] has also pointed out the incapacity, with regard to such objects [necessary for knowledge of duty], of Sense-Perception and the rest, which is to be described hereafter.</p>

  <p>6. Even with regard to purely non-existing objects, the Word brings about some conception. And consequently, in the absence of any discrepancy, authoritative character must be accepted to belong to it by its very nature.<sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote">59</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The later parts of the <em>CS</em> are concerned more with the role and value of testimony as opposed to the other sources of knowledge alluded to here in v. 5, and the earlier portions (up to around v. 102) focus on the general epistemological theses (of interest to us) indicated in v. 6.</p>

<p>The latter verse picks up on a common Mīmāmsā theme, namely the independence of testimony as a source of knowledge:<sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote">60</a></sup> testimony produces cognitions, including of things non-existent, hence which could not have been produced by sense perception or any other <em>pramāna</em>—and thus is a <em>primitive</em> producer of cognitions, i.e. a <em>pramāna</em> in its own right. Now this seems rather problematic. On the one hand Kumārila will not want to count just anything as a <em>pramāna</em> merely because it leads us to think things. But if the point is rather (as I think it is) that testimony can (at least in the case of Vedic testimony regarding duty) provide us with a window on things that other <em>pramānas</em> cannot, then the claim will be question-begging. But this is only a preliminary statement of the view (and fortunately we are not concerned with the case of testimony specifically), so we may simply note that a primitive cognition-producing mechanism is <em>eo ipso</em> a producer of <em>valid</em> cognitions. The starting-point for the discussion of <em>svatah prāmānya</em> is an objection to the Mīmāmsās doctrine that an authorless text is our authority on <em>dharma</em>, the nub of which objection Kumārila presents himself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>22. It is always an object perceived by other means of knowledge that is got at by the Word [testimony]; and, like memory, no authority can belong to it by itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When one accepts testimony, it is because “it is an assertion of a person who is believed to have perceived the object.”<sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote">61</a></sup> In other words, testimony is not a primitive source of knowledge like perception or inference are. The objector adds that we sometimes disregard testimony when we <em>don’t</em> judge the source reliable—and how could that be, if a reliable source isn’t in fact essential to testimony as a source of knowledge?<sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote">62</a></sup> The opponent also makes the objection I worried about a moment ago:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>25. “Thus then, as even when producing a conception, Fancy, &amp;c., are no authorities by themselves, so we may apply the same rule to the case of Veda also.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, again, we do not want to say that just any psychological mechanism which produces some judgment is therefore to be accorded authority.</p>

<p>Kumārila responds by broadening the inquiry, turning away from the specific case of testimony:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>33. With regard to all conceptions, you must consider the following question: “Is the authoritativeness or unauthoritativeness due to itself or to something else?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are three possible positions besides Kumārila’s own:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>34. Because those that are by themselves false cannot by any means be proved to be true. Some people attribute both (authoritativeness and its contrary) to (the conception) itself. Others attribute them to the proved excellences or discrepancies of its origin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the first sentence Kumārila briefly hints at his reason for rejecting the view which will prove to be the principle rival to its own, namely that invalidity is intrinsic and validity extrinsic (he will return to it at v. 38ff, and we return to it on p.  below). The remaining possibilities are, first, that both validity and invalidity might be intrinsic to cognitions, and, second, that both might be extrinsic to cognitions. Verses 35–7 are devoted to rejecting these two possibilities. Regarding the first, Kumārila says that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>35. Both cannot be due to itself, because the two are mutually contradictory<em>$\ldotp\ldotp\ldotp\ldotp$ </em></p>

  <p>36. How can it be possible that any one thing, independent of all extraneous agency, should have contradictory characters? …</p>

  <p>37. If “non-contradictoriness” were possible with regard to different conceptions—even then, if nothing else is taken into consideration, it cannot be ascertained which is which, and where.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We might, uncharitably, see the argument of vv. 35–6 as turning on a confusion of type and token—after all, why shouldn’t some cognitions have the one character and other cognitions the other? Verse 37 would then acknowledge the confusion and offer a better argument. But that would be an unhelpful procedure, and v. 36 offers some textual basis for rejecting this reading. Verse 36 asks not just how cognitions could have contradictory characters, but specifically how anything could have contradictory characters <em>independently of all extraneous agency.</em> If we were talking about a single cognition it would not matter whether or not extraneous agencies were implicated—a single thing could not be valid and invalid at the same time regardless. That suggests that even in vv. 35–6 Kumārila has in mind cognitions in general rather than particular cognitions—some cognitions will be valid and some invalid, but the difference has to be explained by further, external factors.</p>

<p>But why should we have to appeal to extraneous factors to explain the difference? And what then is the real objection in vv. 35–6 to the possibility that both validity and invalidity might be intrinsic? A reasonable possibility is that Kumārila thinks that either validity or invalidity should be in some sense <em>natural</em> to conceptions. But then only one or the other could be natural to cognitions in general, not both. Thus if validity were natural or intrinsic to cognitions then the invalidity of a given cognition would require some further explanation appealing to extrinsic factors. This interpretation would fit the language employed in the string of objections that are shortly posed. Thus 38: “for those that hold the authoritativeness of conceptions to be natural…”; v. 40: “if authoritativeness were inherent or natural…”; v. 44: “while unauthoritativeness, being natural….” So it seems reasonable to say, on the basis of vv. 35–6, that, for Kumārila, the question of the intrinsic or extrinsic nature of validity or invalidity is a question about the natural state of cognitions in general, the point then being that there could be (at most) only one such natural state. Remember that part of what of what Kumārila is considering is whether cognitions are presentative or rather <em>re</em>presentative;<sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote">63</a></sup> here Kumārila is saying that at any rate they aren’t <em>both</em>.</p>

<p>In v. 37 Kumārila sets aside the inquiry into cognitions in general. Now he considers the possibility that cognitions should be considered individually. Might some then be intrinsically valid and others invalid, just as there are both natural redheads and natural blondes? Kumārila now objects that “it cannot be ascertained which is which, and where.” The idea, I think, is this. The suggestion at hand is that some cognitions are presentative by nature and others representative.<sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote">64</a></sup> But in Kumārila’s view, there remains an open question about the accuracy of a representation which does not arise in the case of a presentation. So the suggestion being considered in v. 37 is effectively a suggestion that sometimes cognitions arrive warranted, as it were, while other times cognitions are warranted only when supported or certified by another cognition. The “which is which and where” objection seems very much to the point: Kumārila’s thought would be that the suggestion just mooted undermines the possibility of intrinsic validity altogether—for how could you be warranted in accepting the intrinsically warranted cognitions if you can’t tell them apart from the ones that need to be certified by appeal to another cognition? A cognition that requires either buttressing or discarding must be discarded if you can’t buttress it; but if you can’t tell the cognitions to which that requirement applies apart from the cognitions to which it doesn’t, how can you be rationally required to stand by the latter, given that for all you know they must either be buttressed or discounted? True, there could still <em>be</em> intrinsically warranted beliefs—i.e. cognitions to which you are entitled even if they are not supported by other cognitions. But that entitlement would seem to disappear upon reflection.<sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote">65</a></sup> Much of the epistemological benefit of understanding cognitions as presentative would thus disappear if it is only in the nature of <em>some</em> cognitions or types of cognitions to be presentative.</p>

<p>In the latter halves of vv. 35–6, Kumārila argues that validity and invalidity cannot both be <em>extrinsic</em> to cognitions either.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>35. … Nor can both be due to something else, because in this latter case, there would be no definiteness in the conception.</p>

  <p>36. … And when devoid of both these characters, of what form could the conception be?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here Kumārila restricts his attention to individual cognitions, so if ‘being devoid of both characters’ would mean that a cognition is neither presentative nor representative, neither warranted nor unwarranted, then it’s unsurprising that Kumārila would dismiss this possibility. This seems to be confirmed when we look at what Kumārila means by saying that these cognitions would lack ‘form’ or ‘definiteness.’ Consider v. 168, which comes in the course of a discussion of sentence meaning and the importance of reliable speakers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>168. Though the meaning [of a sentence] may have been comprehended beforehand, yet it depends for its definiteness upon the fact of its originating directly from the [trustworthy] speaker’s cognition; hence such a fact can only be comprehensible through the comprehension of the meaning. But in the matter of authenticity, it takes the first place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems to say that while <em>understanding</em> a sentence is simply a matter of sentence meaning, definiteness and authenticity (ie. validity) are a matter of the source of the belief in question. In any case the “definiteness” of a cognition seems to depend somehow on the causal origin of that cognition. What would that mean? It seems plausible to suppose that Kumārila is gesturing at the difference between merely entertaining a thought and having a thought that is delivered by some belief-producing mechanism which lends it weight (the latter corresponding to Kumārila’s cognition-producing mechanisms).<sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote">66</a></sup> For example, no one considering my hypothetical example of the beautiful Hirut is going to see something to actually believe in that—the example doesn’t assert that some Hirut is a beauty. But if one <em>read</em> that some Hirut is beautiful, the text would effectively present Hirut to you as beautiful. In the latter case the thought would be “definite.”</p>

<p>Considered from the perspective of warrant, the proposal in v. 168 may be urged against the idea that a cognition is warranted only if you can buttress it with some other cognition and that a cognition is also unwarranted only if it is undermined by some other cognition. For suppose that were true. Now you are reading a newspaper, and you read that a certain Hirut is beautiful. And suppose you have no particular reason for doubting this or for distrusting the newspaper. But you can only rationally adopt the belief that Hirut is beautiful if you can ground it in some other cognition. But also you can only reject it if you can oppose it with some other cognition. But then in what sense could this report be offering itself to you for acceptance, if you could accept it only by checking somewhere else for support first, but at the same time can’t rationally reject it either? Of course we could say that the newspaper is just offering you some things for consideration, but this would be exactly Kumārila’s point: you may as well have spent your morning daydreaming, if that’s all reading the newspaper gets you.<sup id="fnref:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote">67</a></sup> [rival] The big question is whether validity is intrinsic and invalidity extrinsic, as Kumārila thinks, or the other way round. Verses 38–46 set out the position of Kumārila’s opponent, and some of the opponent’ reasons for saying that invalidity is intrinsic and validity extrinsic. One objection to Kumārila’s view is offered in v. 40:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>40. “If authoritativeness were inherent or natural and its absence artificial, then dream-cognitions would be authoritative, self-supported; for what is there to refute this?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is nearly a restatement of the objection of v. 25 within the new dialectical context: attention has shifted from modes of knowledge to cognitions. (There Kumārila had claimed that testimony—and thus Vedic testimony—is a source of knowledge since it produces cognitions, and the opponent had objected that cognitions are also produced by plainly problematic mechanisms.) Certainly from the perspective of warrant, the opponent’s view is intuitive: the thought is that, given all the defective ways cognitions can be formed, one can be warranted in thinking something only if one can recognize that one came by that thought in some sound way. My confidence in what I think should be affected, for example, by whether I read it in the <em>National Enquirer</em> or on Wikipedia or in the <em>New York Review of Books</em>, and that requires that I should have some appreciation of how my views originated.</p>

<p>But Kumārila’s response is also intuitive:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>49–51. If even on the birth of conception, the object thereof be not comprehended until the purity of its cause has been ascertained by other means, then in all cases we should have to wait for the production of another conception from a new source; for until its purity has been ascertained, the conception would be equal to nothing. And this second conception too, would be true only on the ascertainment of the purity of its cause; and so on and on, there would be no limit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The opponent thinks that the soundness of your view should turn on your appreciation of the soundness of the origins of your view—but to this sort of verification there is no end, for how can you trust that you have indeed properly assessed the origins of your original view? Your assessment itself might be wrong, and indeed according the opponent the assessment itself should be in doubt until verified. At that rate we will never be entitled to any beliefs.<sup id="fnref:68"><a href="#fn:68" class="footnote">68</a></sup></p>

<p>Though warrant is important here, Kumārila is more directly making a psychological point, as is especially evident from the two preceding verses.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>47. You must understand that authoritativeness is inherent in all Means of Right Notion. For a faculty, by itself non-existing, cannot possibly be brought into existence by any other agency;</p>

  <p>48. since it is only for the sake of its birth that a positive entity requires a cause. And when it has once been born, it’s application to its various effects proceeds naturally out of itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A valid cognition must of course have some causal basis, but once produced it provides comprehension of its object—that is what I take the reference to ‘faculty’ and ‘application’ to mean. Kumārila thinks that if the validity of a cognition—that, say, Hirut is beautiful—depends on some other cognition, then we would not after all have a comprehension of Hirut being beautiful until the further cognition were available. I understand the point here as follows. Suppose you pick up a copy of the <em>New York Times.</em> In it you read a story about Ethiopia. The story is about a singer named Hirut and it reports that she is beautiful. Now suppose you know essentially nothing about the <em>Times</em>, but also have no particular reason to doubt it or to doubt its reliability in this area. (Compare asking someone on the street for the time.) And in fact you come to believe, as a result of reading the story, that there is a beautiful Ethiopian singer named Hirut. Then assuming that the reporter is an honest and careful one, with sound aesthetic sensibilities, hasn’t the <em>Times</em> opened up a bit of the world for you? Doesn’t your new belief constitute a window on a little part of Ethiopia? This is what Kumārila claims is the case: a valid cognition is a window on the world, and nothing more than what has been described is required to open up that window.<sup id="fnref:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote">69</a></sup></p>

<p>Why does Kumārila say that once it has originated, the cognition thereby acts in this way (as this window), and that nothing could make it act this way if it couldn’t do so of it’s own accord? If we considered the matter in terms of <em>thoughts</em> or <em>beliefs</em>, this would seem to be a mistake. Suppose another man reads the story about Hirut, but only in a detached fashion, forming no beliefs, because he dismisses the <em>Times</em> as a part of the reactionary old-media elite. The report that Hirut is beautiful opens no windows for him. But then he reads that the reporter in question supports some bold progressive cause—open borders, perhaps—and thus decides the reporter must be a trustworthy sort after all. He now remembers how this reporter said that a certain Hirut was beautiful, and now believes it. Doesn’t the initial thought about Hirut now serve as a window for him, though one opened by further thoughts?</p>

<p>Here we must remember that Kumarila’s cognitions are not beliefs as we understand them. A cognition is anchored to its genetic origin—to the particular episode of perceiving or of receiving testimony that gave rise to the cognition—in a way that a belief is not. Or again, validity, unlike justification, cannot be provided later for a cognition that lacked it. A cognition either captures a view of the world or it doesn’t, and if it doesn’t then nothing can change that later. You could later come by a new cognition that gives you what the first one might have, but that will just be a different cognition.</p>

<p>So, if the validity of a cognition depends on other cognitions, then we’ll have a regress, while Kumārila’s view avoids that difficulty:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>52. In case, however, authoritativeness be accepted to be due to (the conception) itself, nothing else is wanted (for its cognition). Because in the absence of any cognition of discrepancies, falsity (unauthoritativeness) becomes precluded by itself (i.e. without the help of any extraneous Means).<sup id="fnref:70"><a href="#fn:70" class="footnote">70</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Note that Jhā—rightly—glosses ‘falsity’ here as ‘unauthoritativeness’—i.e. as invalidity. We return to ‘falsity’ in connection with v. 54 below.)</p>

<p>Verse 47 above said that validity is intrinsic to all <em>valid</em> cognitions. But v. 53 has been cited by Taber to support the reading according to which <em>all</em> cognitions are intrinsically valid, and this pair of verses has also been adduced by Tara Chatterjea to show that Kumārila’s work contains “contradictory suggestions” concerning the scope of the <em>svatah prāmānya</em> thesis.<sup id="fnref:71"><a href="#fn:71" class="footnote">71</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Therefore the authoritative character of a conception, cognised through the mere fact of its having the character of “cognition,” can be set aside only by the contrary nature of its object, or by the recognition of discrepancies in its cause.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>But while the discussion (both mine and Kumārila’s) has thus far primarily concerned the first-order cognition, verses 52–3 connect up the first- and second-order elements of the intrinsic validity thesis. We remember that, for Kumārila, a cognition is not itself an object <em>in</em> consciousness, though it manifests some other object <em>to</em> consciousness. If you are aware of a cognition as opposed to its object, that is because this cognition has itself become the object of a <em>further</em> cognition. The <em>svatah prāmānya</em> thesis in this connection concerns the relationship between cognizing a cognition and cognizing that cognition as being (i.e. cognizing it as though it were) valid.<sup id="fnref:72"><a href="#fn:72" class="footnote">72</a></sup> Verse 53 is asserting that the two are the same thing.</p>

<p>Why are cognitions apprehended as valid? Because to reflect upon a cognition just is to reflect upon the world which that cognition reveals. Such reflection presupposes that the initial cognition constitutes your view of the world. For suppose instead that, upon recognizing and attending to the belief that Hirut is beautiful, you were not to apprehend it as valid—whether actually as invalid or somehow as neither valid nor invalid. Then that very second-order cognition would undermine the first-order cognition. Even granting that the initial cognition were valid up to that point, there would now be a new cognition to the effect that the first cognition is invalid or false or doubtful or whatever the case may be. Of course this new cognition might itself be invalid, but that will not always be so, even when it is false. So reflection will be a way of undermining your cognitions, except to the extent that you are able to identify some support for them. But, thinks Kumārila, reflection should not undermine our beliefs in that way. So the two forms of the <em>svatah prāmānya</em> thesis mesh nicely, and both are supported by the appeal to the threat of infinite regress. In v. 54 Kumarila identifies several varieties of invalidity:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>54. Unauthoritativeness is three-fold: as being due to falsity, non-perception, and doubt. From among these, two (falsity and doubt) being positive entities, are brought about by discrepancies in the cause.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the reference to ‘positive entities,’ Kumārila responds to ontological qualms of a pan-Indian variety concerning explanation; that need not detain us.<sup id="fnref:73"><a href="#fn:73" class="footnote">73</a></sup> The reference to ‘discrepancies’ is more important for our purposes: the proponent of intrinsic invalidity will claim that a cognition is rendered valid when the mechanisms which produced it are seen to have been sound, whereas Kumārila claims that a cognition is shown invalid when the mechanism is shown to have been defective, i.e. to have had ‘discrepancies.’ In v. 54 Kumārila is thus cataloguing the ways in which a cognition can be rendered invalid and saying that two of these ways are indeed reducible to the the identification of discrepancies.<sup id="fnref:74"><a href="#fn:74" class="footnote">74</a></sup> (The third, non-perception, will be a special case.)</p>

<p>By ‘falsity,’ Kumarila means not the actual falsity or inaccuracy of the initial cognition; rather he is addressing the case in which some such inaccuracy is turned up, or in which some defect in the mechanism behind the cognition is turned up, so that the initial cognition is altogether overturned. The case of doubt requires not so much an overturning as an unsettling; thus in a stock Indian example you might be unsure whether you’re looking at (or saw) a piece of silver or rather a bit of shell. Kumārila is considering these two cases in vv. 57–61:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>57. Unauthoritativeness (falsity) is got at directly through the “Cognition (of its contradictory).” For, so long as the former is not set aside, the subsequent cognition (of its contradictory) cannot be produced.</p>

  <p>58. Though the cognition of the discrepancy of the cause is known to refer to a different object (<em>i.e.</em>, not the object which is the effect of tlie cause), yet we have co-objectivity (of the two cognitions) as being implied thereby; and hence we have the preclusion of the former,—as in the case of the “milking-pot.”<sup id="fnref:75"><a href="#fn:75" class="footnote">75</a></sup></p>

  <p>59. But this rule applies only to those cases in which (with regard to the second conception) there is neither cognition of any discrepancy, nor any contradictory conception. In those cases, however, in which we have any of these two factors, the second conception becoming false, the first comes to be true.</p>

  <p>60. But in that case too, the authoritativeness is due to the conception itself, in the absence of any cognition of discrepancies. And in a case where there is no such cognition of discrepancies, there is no reasonable ground for doubt.</p>

  <p>61. Thus (in this manner) we do not stand in need of postulating more than three or four conceptions. And it is for this reason that we hold to the doctrine of “Self-evidence” [i.e. <em>svatah prāmānya</em>].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ‘falsity’ case well illustrates one form of the extrinsic nature of invalidity. It is in having the new cognition that the earlier one is set aside and rendered invalid. And should the new cognition itself prove faulty, the original cognition is valid again not because it has gained new support but because the objections have been lifted—thus the validity of a valid cognition is intrinsic even if it loses and regains that status.<sup id="fnref:76"><a href="#fn:76" class="footnote">76</a></sup></p>

<p>This is not just a psychological point. It may be that, as a psychological matter, it’s impossible to credit both the old idea that Hirut is beautiful and the new idea that she’s plain, but as a psychological matter one could reject the new information rather than the old. But, for Kumarila, the new cognition is itself intrinsically valid, barring some further problem with <em>it</em>. The process of discarding the old way of looking at things is, moreover, an inferential process and not merely a causal one. This is clearest in the case where a cognition is not just straightforwardly at odds with the earlier cognition in terms of its content, but where the new cognition reveals something problematic about the causal basis of the original cognition, which is the case Kumarila considers in v. 58. For an example, imagine that rather than seeing Hirut and finding her plain, you learn that the <em>Times</em> reporter in question has abnormal aesthetic sensibilities. And notice, finally, that v. 60 above is explicit that there is a question of rationality here: it would be a <em>mistake</em> to give up your view of Hirut’s beauty barring some specific reason for doing so.</p>

<p>When in the case of ‘falsity’ a cognition is set aside, it is, in a sense, not really even apt for validity any more, since it no longer constitutes one’s view of the world anyway. Likewise with the case of doubt; the view has been suspended in a way that would make it inappropriate to ask, for example, whether the subject is justified in holding it.<sup id="fnref:77"><a href="#fn:77" class="footnote">77</a></sup> The same point holds doubly for the case of non-perception, the case in which you were simply not in contact with the world at all, as might be the case in dreams, or the aforementioned case of ‘fancy,’ or wishful thinking:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>In the case of non-perception, however, we do not admit the action of such discrepancies. Because for us all non-perception is due to the <em>absence</em> of cause,—just as you have asserted.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>This case is important because it illustrates a claim I’ve made a couple of times, namely that cognition must have a certain causal origin if it was ever to have validity in the first place. ‘Fancy’ and wishful thinking, for example, are not sources of valid cognition,<sup id="fnref:78"><a href="#fn:78" class="footnote">78</a></sup> but only special cases of non-perception. We remember that v. 48 had said that it was only for its birth that a positive entity required a cause—here there is no (sound) cause in the first place, and no positive entity (i.e. no valid cognition). This implicitly offers a response to the dream objection of v. 40.</p>

<p>The non-perception case also allows us to appreciate more clearly that validity cannot be anything like <em>truth.</em> If I daydream the beautiful Hirut into existence, and later forget it was a daydream and come actually to believe that there was a beautiful Ethiopian singer named Hirut, the belief may or may not in fact be <em>true</em>; Ethiopia has its singers, Hirut is a reasonably common name there, and it is a land of beautiful women; some woman may very well be all of these things. But there is no question or possibility of <em>validity</em> here. Validity requires a causal basis (such as testimony or perception) that can (though may not always) mediate some kind of contact between you and the word. If there’s no actual chain between the world and your thoughts about it, you can’t have valid cognitions about it. Kumārila applies his conclusions to the case of testimony:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>64. In (truthful) human (speech) we find two (factors)—<em>absence of discrepancies,</em> and (<em>presence of</em>) <em>excellence</em>; and we have already explained that authoritativeness cannot be due to <em>excellence</em>.</p>

  <p>65–6. Therefore excellences must be held to help only in the removal of discrepancies; and from the absence of these latter (discrepancies), proceeds the absence of the two kinds of unauthoritativeness; and thus the fact of (authoritativeness) being inherent in Words remains untouched. And inasmuch as the word gives rise to a conception, its authoritativeness is secured.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When Kumārila says it has already been explained that validity cannot be due to the excellences of testimony, he must mean that a cognition is not valid in virtue of <em>recognizing</em> that the source of knowledge—in this case testimony—was free of fault. He exploits this point to respond to the objection that his own view does face a regress despite his earlier protestations:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>“If the absence of discrepancies be held to result from excellences, then there is the same <em>regressus ad infinitum</em> (that you urged against us.”</li>
  </ol>

  <p>67. (Not so): because at that time (ie. at the time of the conception of the absence of discrepancies), we do not admit of any active functioning of the excellences, though they continue to be recognised all the same;—because in the conception of the absence of discrepancies they help by their mere presence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As we have seen before, one need not actually have an appreciation of the soundness of the basis of a conception for it to be valid.</p>

<p>There is also a slight puzzle here, though, because v. 67 seems to suggest that in fact a valid cognition <em>must</em> have a <em>sound</em> basis—i.e. a source without discrepancies. But that cannot be right, because it would mean that testimonial cognitions are not after all valid just as such, and, as we can see even here (from the the last sentence of vv. 65–6), validity <em>does not</em> depend on the actual faultlessness of the testimony in question: testimony just as such <em>is</em> a source of valid cognitions. I therefore take v. 67 to mean that the <em>presumed</em> excellences of the source of a cognition suffice (so far as the source is of an approved variety: testimony, perception, etc.). This is further confirmed by the next verses, as we turn to the case of the Vedas, where Kumārila claims that the very testimonial nature of Vedic-derived cognitions imbues them with validity:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>70. Hence the mere fact of the Veda not having been composed by an authoritative author, ceases to be a discrepancy<em>$\ldotp\ldotp\ldotp\ldotp$ </em></p>

  <p>71. It is only human speech that depends for its authority upon another Mean of Right Knowlede; and hence in the absence of the latter, the former becomes faulty; but the other (ie. Vedic sentences) can never be so (on that ground).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have returned here to the second-order case: testimonial cognitions may be presumed sound just on the basis of being testimonial cognitions, though in the typical or human case, where testimonial knowledge is parasitic on other sources of knowledge, that presumption would be overruled by the observation that the testifier had no way of coming by his supposed knowledge. In the case of the Vedas, no such difficulty can arrive, and the presumption stands.</p>

<p>Verse 72 returns us to the matter of independence:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Thus then, the very fact of the incompatibility of the Veda with other Means of Right Notion, constitutes its authoritativeness; for if it were not so incompatible, it would only be subsidiary (to other such means).</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>The point here is that since Vedic testimony produces cognitions which could never be called into question by any other source of knowledge, the Vedas are an authority: they produce cognitions which must be trusted. This may seem to reopen our question about dreams and fancies. Perhaps you have dreams about the future, and come to have beliefs about the future in that way, and these beliefs cannot be undermined by perception or inference. Does that make dreaming authoritative concerning the future? Kumārila does not think so, but not, I think, for deep reasons of epistemological theory proper. It is just that dreaming and Vedic testimony are different cases. On Kumārila’s view, dreams and fancies just take the matter of perception and mix it up in arbitrary ways; they are not new sources of information. One could, of course, say the same about the Vedas—but then you wouldn’t be a <em>Mīmāmsāka</em>. Kumārila thinks that language and meaning are deep and primitive aspects of the cosmos, that the cosmos is eternal, that it’s reasonable to suppose that the Vedas were never written, and that they tap into eternal meanings somehow. Those are matters separate from epistemology, nor does Kumārila suppose himself to have defended any of those claims at this stage.<sup id="fnref:79"><a href="#fn:79" class="footnote">79</a></sup> We pass over vv. 73–81, which continue discussing the independence of Vedas, and arrive at an objection in v. 82:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>82. (Objection): “But Sense-Perception and the rest are not comprehended as that ‘these are authoritative’; nor is it possible to carry on any business by means of such perceptions, when they are not comprehended as such.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The opponent objects that since in forming cognitions we do not yet have any confidence in those cognitions, they cannot be a basis for action or further inference. In responding, Kumārila provides a helpful recapitulation of his view.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>(Reply): Even prior to comprehension, the Means of Right Notion had an independent existence of their own and they come to be comprehended subsequently (as such), through other cognitions.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>A cognition is valid and serves as a basis for action and inference even without any recognition of its existence; when its existence is recognized, this is in a new cognition.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>84. Therefore the fact of its being comprehended as such, does not in any way help the authoritativeness (of the Means of Right Notion); because the idea of the object is got at through the former alone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second-order recognition of a cognition as valid is not necessary for the validity of that first-prder cognition, nor can it confer validity upon it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Even the unauthoritative Means would, by itself, lead to the conception of its object; and its function would not cease unless its falsity were ascertained by other means.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Even an invalid cognition manifests the world, though it may do so wrongly (it may for example ‘reveal’ a real shell to be a piece of silver<sup id="fnref:80"><a href="#fn:80" class="footnote">80</a></sup>), but until it is revealed as misleading it is accepted, and forms a basis for further inference. Notice here that a cognition can be invalid but still manifest the world. We should also see here a connection to action: so far as v. 85 itself goes, we might think that the ‘function’ of a cognitions was restricted to manifestation, and that may indeed be the primary meaning, but in the context of the objection of the objection at v. 82, Kumārila evidently means that, in virtue of the exercising its function, a cognition (even an invalid one) functions as a basis for action.</p>

<p>Finally we end with a reiteration of the intrinsicality of validity and the extrinsicality of invalidity:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>86. The falsity of an object is not, like its truthfulness, perceived by its very first conception. For the recognition of unauthoritativeness, the only cause is one’s consciousness of the falsity of its subject itself, or of he faultiness of the cause thereof.</p>

  <p>87. Thereby alone is falsity (of a conception) established; and by no other means. And the truthfulness (or authoritativeness of a conception) is proved to <em>belong to the state of its birth</em> (<em>i.e.</em>, is natural or inherent in it).</p>

  <p>88. Therefore even in cases where falsity is proved by other means, these two (causes of falsity) should be noted, and not only certain points of similarity (with another false idea).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have clarified a number of puzzles about the text that remained in other interpretations, and found confirmation for the approach I laid out in the previous section. We have reaped these rewards primarily by simply attending carefully to the difference between the first- and second-order aspects of the <em>svatah prāmāya</em> thesis.</p>

<h2 id="kumrilas-conception-of-knowledge">Kumārila’s Conception of Knowledge</h2>

<p>Since we wish to sympathize with Kumārila’s theory rather than only to set it out, it will be helpful to conclude by looking briefly at a couple of historical comparisons.</p>

<p>For analogies with Kumārila’s intrinsically valid cognitions, Taber adduces Descartes’ “clear and distinct ideas,” the truth of which are self-evident, and, again, the Stoic’s notion of a ‘<em>φαντασία καταληπτική</em>,’ an impression or appearance which contains some mark guaranteeing its own truth or accuracy.<sup id="fnref:81"><a href="#fn:81" class="footnote">81</a></sup> Taber grants that, in contrast with <em>kataleptic</em> impressions or clear and distinct ideas, intrinsically valid cognitions are common; on Taber’s interpretation all cognitions are at least initially intrinsically valid. But the more important disanalogy, which Taber must himself insist on, but nevertheless seems really to <em>spoil</em> the analogy, is that intrinsically valid cognitions needn’t be true, whereas the whole point of the Stoic and Cartesian notions is to isolate a special class of impressions or ideas which are sure to be such. J. N. Mohanty is, I think, right in saying that the whole spirit of Kumārila’s view is to <em>reject</em> the notion of self-evidence:</p>

<p>it is precisely the contention of the <em>svatahprāmānya</em> theory…that <em>there is no criterion of truth, though there are criteria of error.</em><sup id="fnref:82"><a href="#fn:82" class="footnote">82</a></sup></p>

<p>A nearer Hellenistic counterpart for Kumārila is Philo. According to what seems to be the dominant reconstruction, Philo, who led the Academy for some time, was initially a radical skeptic in the manner of Clitomachus, then later adopted the mitigated skepticism of Metrodorus, and finally in his (unfortunately not extant) ‘Roman Books’ advocated a sort of fallibilism.<sup id="fnref:83"><a href="#fn:83" class="footnote">83</a></sup> The Academics seem to have generally accepted (if only for the purpose of launching counter-arguments) the Stoic understanding of knowledge, which required the afore-mentioned <em>kataleptic</em> impressions: knowledge requires an accurate impression appropriately caused by what it represents, and which contains some mark which shows that it meets those two conditions. The Academics argued that there were no such impressions, since any true impression could be mimicked by a false one. The skeptics, like the Stoics, thought that one ought not to assent to what one does not know; thus a radical skeptic would ideally refuse ever to assent to anything. A mitigated skepticism, on the other hand, would allow the reasonableness of forming some beliefs even without allowing the existence of a criterion of truth; some appearances might at least constitute good, if never conclusive, evidence. But ultimately Philo reinterpreted the notion of a <em>kataleptic</em> impression, accepting the requirements of truth and of a suitable causal basis, but removing the requirement that such an impression guarantee its own truth, which he still considered to constitute an impossible standard. This meant that it might not only be reasonable to form beliefs but that <em>kataleptic</em> impressions were after all possible, and one might rationally accept these without qualificaton. But since the requirement for a criterion of truth had been abandoned, one might very well be mistaken about whether one actually possessed a <em>kataleptic</em> impression.</p>

<p>Philo’s innovation provoked a good deal of hostility. He had, in effect, given up the idea that knowledge must be certain (or infallible)—something assumed by dogmatists and skeptics alike. Kumārila’s validity does not require truth, but, like Philo, he decided that the reigning epistemic standard was impossible for any cognition to attain, and thus redefined it so that it could be claimed as a matter of course, as it properly should have been. As with Philo’s view, this view was met by complaints from outside Kumārila’s own school and with disbelief from inside it. Thus a later commentator, Umbeka, found a way interpret Kumārila as making validity entail truth after all. In India, as in the Hellenistic world, knowledge was supposed to be infallible, and Kumārila’s innovation, like Philo’s, lies precisely in giving up that requirement as in any case impossible.</p>

<p>In both cases, the reinterpretation of knowledge is at least in part a response to the demands of practical activity. A major criticism of the radically skeptical position was that it made action and virtue impossible, since both require belief. Efforts were made to reconcile action with the skeptics’ traditional refusal to assent, but the mitigated skeptical position amounted to a way of allowing assent without admitting the possibility of knowledge or certainty. Since the mitigated position winds up buying into dogmatic conception of knowledge in a way that radical skeptics could claim to avoid (the latter could more easily claim to ‘accept’ it only to attack it), the Philonian position can be understood as an attempt to just find a new understanding of knowledge that was a better fit with the practical considerations driving the mitigated skeptics’ concessions in the first place.</p>

<p>Kumārila likewise reinvents the notion of knowledge to allow for the demands of practice. Moral or <em>dharmic</em> knowledge will be impossible without the authority of Vedic texts—the Buddhists, for example, are wrong to suppose that perception will suffice. But Vedic testimony cannot meet the standards imposed by the epistemological theories of other schools, which would require either a kind of self-evidence of which no cognition is capable, or verification which is in this case impossible. How then would one pursue <em>dharma</em>? Human beings must act, and they must have moral guidance. It cannot be unreasonable to act as best you can, relying on the best resources available, even if the soundness of these resources cannot be established. That is part of what it is to be reasonable, and the standards of theoretical reason are misconceived if they seem to say otherwise.</p>

      <p>Testimony (<em>śabda</em>) is sometimes treated under the heading of ‘injunction’ (<em>codanā</em>) because the Mīmāmsā school is concerned with Vedic testimony insofar as it offers prescriptions for living, whether in a grammatical form or not (see also n. [invisiblenote] above).

      <p>Taber (p. 215, n. 56) cites v. 80 in support of the idea that the passage of time improves confidence, but while the verse shows that Kumārila is trying to make more than a psychological point, I cannot see in it any indication that he is thinking about the passage of time, except in the trivial sense that a counter-indicating cognition would come after the initial cognition. Taber also adduces <em>TS</em> 2904, but again I see in that verse only the claim that cognitions are valid if they’re not upset by other cognitions. Kumārila refers in this verse to cognitions occurring at “other times and places,” but that doesn’t mean that length of time (or travel experience, for that matter) makes a difference to warrant except insofar as counter-indication cognitions would, by their nature, have to occur at other times.[tabertextual] <a href="#fnref:32" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>A complicating factor here is the Mīmāmsā adherence to the view (very contentious in the Indian setting) that ‘absence’ (<em>abhāva</em>) is a sound means of acquiring knowledge. That is, one may rightly infer from the absence of any indication of something that it doesn’t exist. But this principle makes no appeal to the passage of time, and Kumārila is liberal and reasonable about what counts as an indication of a real or potential difficulty about evidence. Taber does not rely on an appeal to <em>abhāva</em> in his defense of <em>svatah prāmānya</em>. <a href="#fnref:36" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>It is particularly characteristic of the Indian tradition to (as we would see it) transform normative or evaluative questions into epistemological or metaphysical questions, so far as possible. Most notoriously, there seems to have been virtually no direct philosophical inquiry into final ends—no ethics or moral philosophy in the Western sense. The introduction has already given an illustration of the kind of thing that happened instead: debates about final ends were fought by proxy, in terms of epistemology, ontology, perception, language, and so on, with each school developing an increasingly sophisticated philosophical apparatus to buttress their approach to duty or liberation.

      <p>Jhā refers to ‘cognitions’ as ‘conceptions’; ‘validity’ is ‘authoritativeness’; `intrinsic is ‘inherent’; Jhā also uses ‘means of right notion’ to refer to a valid cognition. <a href="#fnref:59" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>At least that’s how Kumārila, a realist, would look at the matter. As indicated in §[interpreting] above, other Indian philosophers would have seen the matter differently. It’s not clear that Kumārila is really trying to seriously respond to such views as opposed to just considering all of the possibilities in a realistic spirit. <a href="#fnref:64" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>At present we are asking a question about the warrant of the first-order cognition, and not a question about how it can be <em>determined</em> whether a first-order cognition is warranted. But one part of the suggestion in the contemplated scenario is that some cognitions may be warranted only <em>if</em> assessed in a certain way. <a href="#fnref:65" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
