Introduction: The Mīmāmsā Inquiry into Dharma =============================================

The Pūrva Mīmāmsā was first of all a school of exegesis. The great bulk of their bulky founding text, the *Mīmāmsā Sūtra*, set down in the 1st or 2nd century AD and credited to one Jaiminī, treats interpretative difficulties in the Vedas, discusses their study, or details rules for settling procedural questions regarding sacrificial ritual. But by the first century, the heyday of ritual was long past, and there was much skepticism as to whether Mīmāmsā’s constitutive aim—according to *MS* I.i.1 the inquiry into *dharma* (i.e. pursuit of the highest good)—was best pursued in the Mīmāmsā fashion. Besides Buddhists, Jains, and the plainly nihilistic Cārvākas, there were rival exegetical schools, and many Hindus who acknowledged the authority of the Vedas attributed them to gods—unlike the atheistic Mīmāmsākas, who claimed that the scriptures had simply always existed. It would have seemed appropriate to establish some philosophical foundation for the school.

And so indeed several epistemological theses are set out in the first chapter of the *Mīmāmsā Sūtra*, beginning with v. I.i.4:

> Perception is knowledge which one has by the senses coming in contact with the soul. It is not the cause of duty [*dharma*] by reason of acquiring knowledge of the thing existing.[^1]

[^1]: Trans. [@jaimini1923mimamsa]. For style, clarity, or to remove or add glosses, I’ve lightly altered most of the older translations I’ve quoted. Meaning has not (I hope) been affected.

Indian texts are characteristically cryptic. Pithily rendered verses are meant to be committed to memory and elucidated orally by teachers, or studied with the aid of commentaries (themselves cryptic). But the *Mīmāmsā Sūtra* is difficult even by these standards. Some psychological theory is obviously being appealed to in this verse—the *MS* may only have been written around the 1st century, but it codifies ideas of much great antiquity.[^2] But we must be satisfied—as Mīmāmsākas of later generations had to be—with the text itself and the only slightly less difficult 5th-century commentary of Śābara.

[^2]: For a survey of the school see e.g. [@keith1921karma].

But, following Śābara, the import of the present verse is reasonably clear. For Mīmāmsākas, *dharma* concerns a causal system relating actions and future outcomes, so that to perceive *dharma* would be to perceive the future. And this verse points out that sense perception makes contact only with what exists presently. So *dharma* can’t be learned about through perception. (The Buddha, for example, was supposed to have done just that.)

Happily for us, the Vedas attest to *dharma*:

>   *MS* I.i.5. Certainly there is eternal connection between the word and its >   meaning; its knowledge is injunction; it is never erroneous in matters >   invisible; it is authoritative in the opinion of Bādarāyana[^3] by reason of >   its not depending on others.

[^3]: Credited with the *Brahma* (or *Vedānta*) *Sūtras*.

This is yet more puzzling than the previous verse, and unfortunately Śābara offers little more than a paraphrase, though he notes the importance of ruling out other potential ways of knowing *dharma*, for example by inference or analogy.[^4] We seem to be confronted, then, with the claim that testimony (i.e. Vedic testimony) is infallible with regard to “matters invisible” (specifically *dharma*).[^5] The reason for this is, apparently, that Vedic testimony about *dharma* does not depend upon “others”: it does not ultimately rely on any of the other legitimate sources of knowledge catalogued by Śābara.[^6] In other words, testimony, which in the ordinary case—and Mīmāmsā joins every other Indian school on this point—can only convey knowledge which was originally acquired in some other way, is, in the special case of *dharmic* knowledge, an infallible authority, precisely *because* no other means of acquiring knowledge will do the job. And thus I.i.2:

[^4]: *Śābarabhāsya ad loc.*.

[^5]: The restriction to matters invisible was taken seriously by Mīmāmsā: what the Vedas said about anything other than *dharma* was reinterpreted or disregarded.[invisiblenote]

[^6]: I leave aside the part about the eternal connection between words and meanings, which would take us too far afield. Suffice it to say that the Mīmāmsākas spilt a good deal of ink developing an ontology and a philosophy of language to make room for the idea of testimony that is authoritative but authorless. See 1.

>   Duty is a purpose having injunction for its sole authority.[^7]

[^7]: Trans. [@jha1907skb].

We should remember we don’t have much idea how these ideas might have been fleshed out in the earlier centuries of the Mīmāmsā school. We ought also to allow for the distance between ourselves and these medieval atheistic scriptural exegetes who take the authorless but eternal and transcendent texts of the Hindu Vedas as the only possible authority for their ritualistic morality. (Although atheists do still walk among us.) We note in particular that India worked hard not to record any history: the names of the authors of *many* Indian texts are little more than conventions, and

>   we can read thousands of pages of Sanskrit on any imaginable subject and not >   encounter a single passing reference to a historical person, place, or >   event—or at least to any that, historically speaking, matters.[^8]

[^8]: Thus [@pollock1989mima], who argues that Mīmāmsā itself encouraged the rejection of history. But there was already fertile soil, e.g. in the cyclical conception of the universe.

The *Mīmāmsā Sūtra*’s bold epistemology of *dharma* is at least a little more intelligible given such facts and the attendant conceptions of the cosmos and our place therein. Indeed the idea that language has a natural or eternal status seems to have been anticipated in earlier grammatical texts.[^9]

[^9]:  

But it hardly need be said that this doesn’t *vindicate* Mīmāmsā epistemology. Nor were the philosophers of other Indian schools much impressed. There can still be little wonder, then, if even one of the most serious and sympathetic recent scholars of Indian philosophy has found in this aspect of Mīmāmsā “a kind of fundamentalism.”[^10]

[^10]: [@matilal1986perception]; see [@arnold2001ivr] on the modern reception of the doctrine of *svatah prāmānya*.

Enter Kumārila Bhatta, a 7th century Mīmāmsāka. His *Ślokavārtika*, comprising well over three thousand verses, corresponds to just the first thirty-two verses of the *Mīmāmsā Sūtra*—i.e. those verses which had set out the philosophical basis of Mīmāmsā. In this paper we are primarily concerned with the second chapter of the *Ślokavārtika*, the *Codanāsūtra*, or chapter on injunction. The *Codanāsūtra* is framed as a commentary on *MS* I.i.2 (see above).[^11] Kumārila defends the authority of the Vedas on matters of *dharma* by way of a quite general epistemological thesis, the ‘*svatah prāmānya*,’ or ‘intrinsic validity’ thesis:

[^11]: Testimony (*śabda*) is sometimes treated under the heading of ‘injunction’ (*codanā*) because the Mīmāmsā school is concerned with Vedic testimony insofar as it offers prescriptions for living, whether in a grammatical form or not (see also n. [invisiblenote] above. In our passages, Kumārila is explicitly treating *śabda* in general (vv. 7–8).

>   The validity of all valid cognitions is to be understood as intrinsic, since >   a potency not existing intrinsically cannot be brought about by something >   else.[^12]

[^12]: II.47–8, trans. [@taber1992dkb].

The interpretation of this thesis occupies the bulk of this paper. But it’s uncontroversial that Kumārila is claiming that “cognitions” (‘*jñāna*’ approximates to occurrent judgment) is (in some way) epistemically legitimate by default, or immediately. This will ultimately support the authority of the Vedas, since the ideas conveyed by Vedic testimony will also have immediate legitimacy.[^13] And there is no danger that anything will undermine this legitimacy, since in principle no other mode of knowledge acquisition (no other *pramāna*, in the Sanskrit terminology) provides knowledge of *dharma*.[^14]

[^13]: Thus v. 68: “Then, too, in the case of the Veda, the assertion of *freedom from reproach* is very easy to put forward, because there is no speaker in this case; and for this reason the unauthoritativeness of the Veda can never even be imagined.”

[^14]: vv. 13–18.

The application of the doctrine of *svatah prāmānya* to the question of Vedic authority has understandably provoked suspicion. But as John Taber has pointed out, the thesis doesn’t in its own right entail the authoritativeness of the Veda. That requires accepting the Vedas’ authorlessness, which demands a good deal of theorizing about language and the ontology of reference, the nature of the other *pramānas*, and so on. And this is Kumārila’s own understanding of the dialectical situation. So one could accept the Mīmāmsā school’s most general epistemological theses while rejecting Vedic authority. And I believe Taber is also right in arguing that, whatever its provenance, the *svatah prāmānya* thesis has merit. But I’m also inclined to go further. If we may take *dharma* as corresponding roughly to *morality*, or to practical concerns of the highest order,[^15] then most elements of the Mīmāmsā outloook, *including* the relationship between epistemology and *dharmic* (or moral) authority, are not terribly foreign. The Mīmāmsā see *dharma* as a casual system which, properly understood, allows one to realize one’s ultimate good. That idea that moral or ethical life allows one to realize one’s good has had an enormous influence in Western thought; the suggestion that morality is a system of broadly instrumental rules is not foreign even to the contemporary discussion.[^16] A general worry about how moral epistemology is possible, manifest in the Mīmāmsā attacks on other philosophical schools as well as in their own recourse to scripture, is a pervasive theme in contemporary metaethics.[^17] The view that moral properties are in some way non-natural, and would thus require some special variety of epistemological insight, likewise retains enormous influence.[^18] The idea that moral knowledge, or some moral knowledge, has ultimately a divine provenance also has its contemporary defenders. None of this is to say that these positions must therefore be plausible (I myself see nothing at all persuasive in some of these views), and there is also the (hardly trivial) matter of combining these various ideas into a coherent theory. The point is rather this: once we realize that the only element of the Mīmāmsā view that will not be familiar from even a relatively limited exposure to moral philosophy in a contemporary philosophy department is the specific means—namely the Vedas conceived of as authorless—by which moral knowledge is acquired—and that is only an accident of history—then we can understand Mīmāmsā epistemology as, in part, constituting *an attempt to reconcile a general epistemological theory with a moral epistemology.* The Mīmāmsākas will be no means have been the first to espouse a conception of knowledge that answers to practical as well as theoretical considerations; the thought that what constitutes reasonable belief may well depend in part on the demands laid upon us as practical creatures is again a familiar one, and this time it’s surely a reasonable one as well.[^19]

[^15]: The difficulties here will be roughly analogous to the difficulties in comparing modern morality theory with ancient (Greek) ethical theory.

[^16]: I think especially of Philippa Foot’s “Morality as a System of Hypothetical Imperatives” [@foot1972morality]—but she has repudiated that view, for example in [@foot2003natural].

[^17]: The classic statement being [@mackie1977ethics], though he is much motivated by the purportedly non-instrumental nature of moral demands.

[^18]: See again [@mackie1977ethics] for the skeptical view. For the positive view, [@moore1903principia] is the *locus classicus*; cf. more recently [@huemer2005ethical]. But the terms of metaethical debate of the last century *in general* were set by Moore.

[^19]: See further [@clooney1987vhn] and 1.

Kumārila’s *svatah prāmānya* thesis *can* be considered independently of the matter of moral knowledge. That is just what I’ll do in §3. But to appreciate the theory’s merits and motives, it is necessary to discuss Kumārila’s epistemology more broadly, which I’ll do in §3. But first, in §2, I identify some interpretative difficulties, and some interpretative constraints.

Interpreting Kumārila’s Epistemology ====================================

Interpretative Issues ---------------------

Some difficulties in reconstructing Kumārila’s epistemology, including the extraordinary concision of the texts, are characteristic of Indian philosophy. That concision allowed plenty of scope for commentaries on Jaiminī and Śābara to rival Kumārila’s; later commentators on Kumārila were likewise able to differ greatly in interpreting *him*.

The difficulty is compounded by the commentarial nature of the Indian traditions. A school is associated with certain views, and conspicuous novelty is avoided. Thus all of the members of a given school will defend nominally the same answer to what is nominally a single question of inter-school interest. In fact different schools, and different writers within a school, may be answering different questions.[^20]

[^20]: Cf. [@mohanty1989gangesa].

The *svatah prāmānya* thesis is a case in point. Every school had a position on whether *prāmānya* was *svatah* or *paratah* to cognitions. In English this is often glossed as a question about whether the ‘truth’ or ‘validity’ (*prāmānya*) of a cognition is intrinsic (*svatah*) or rather extrinsic (*paratah*) to that cognition. A scholar might well begin a survey by saying that the Nyāya school holds that truth is extrinsic to cognitions—where the Nyāya view is roughly that there is never a feature of a cognition which establishes that cognition’s ‘truth’—and then go on to explain how the Buddhists think that both truth *and* falsity are extrinsic to cognitions, even though that would be an absurdity on the Nyāya understanding of ‘truth.’ But Buddhists can say that *prāmānya* and *aprāmānya* (‘invalidity’ or ‘falsity’) are both *paratah* because they have a quite different understanding of *prāmānya*. Buddhists and Naiyāyikas are different enough that no-one is much confused about this, but Mīmāmsā is closer to Nyāya and less understood. And just how little value there is in saying that the Mīmāmsā believe that *prāmānya* is *svatah* is only further brought out by the observation that there were plainly different understandings of the thesis in the different branches of Mīmāmsā, and also among Kumārila’s own later followers.[^21] ‘Intrinsic validity’ as a gloss for “the” Mīmāmsā thesis has a long history, and is well-represented in recent discussions,[^22] so that even if there were a better gloss it would be silly to change now. But the phrase must not be supposed to convey much.

[^21]: So for example Prabhākara before Kumārila, and Umbeka, Pārthasārathi, and Sucarita after him—see [@chatterjea2003svatah] and 2 for brief accounts.

[^22]: [@keith1921karma] and [@radhakrishnan1927indian], 2 and [@arnold2001ivr].

Rival Interpretations ---------------------

Let us return to Kumārila’s thesis:

>   The validity of all valid cognitions is to be understood as intrinsic, since >   a potency not existing intrinsically cannot be brought about by something >   else. And [in general] things depend on [other] causes in arising, but once >   they exist they exercise their functions by themselves.[^23]

[^23]: vv. 47–8; cf. e.g. vv. 6, 80.

To start, we can say at least that validity, which is intrinsic, contrasts with invalidity, which is extrinsic. In the following verses, Kumārila supports these claims with a regress argument: if cognitions were not *intrinsically* valid, they would have to derive validity from further cognitions. Those other cognitions must themselves have to be valid if they are to help, but then, by the hypothesized extrinsic nature of validity, there would have to be yet further cognitions validating *them*, and so on *ad infinitem.*[^24] Thus validity must be intrinsic. But while other cognitions cannot make a cognition valid, they *can* make it *invalid*, and hence invalidity is extrinsic.[^25]

[^24]: E.g. vv. 49–51.

[^25]: E.g. vv. 52–3, 56, 86–7.

Notwithstanding the interpretative difficulties noted above, this reasoning allows us to eliminate at least some possible readings of ‘validity.’ So, for Buddhist philosophers, the world is made up of fleeting particulars, and association or categorization of them, as found in thought, is *ipso facto* a falsification. The notion of ‘validity,’ then, if it is to have utility, cannot be understood in terms of a correspondence between mind and world, but will rather be made out in pragmatic terms: a cognition is valid if the expectations it generates are not frustrated. Validity will then be *extrinsic* to cognitions, since frustration or satisfaction of resulting expectations comes only after the cognition itself. So to say that validity is *intrinsic* rules out at least such a view.[^26] But that doesn’t narrow the options enormously.

[^26]: But even with Kumārila it’s not trivial to rule out a pragmatic understanding. Karl [@potter1984diepotter1992presuppositions] has argued that ‘knowledge’ has *always* more a pragmatic than a theoretical import in Indian philosophy—but see [@mohanty1984pramanya]. A pragmatic understanding of validity was read into the *SV* itself by Sucarita Miśra, a later Mīmāmsā commentator—see [@chatterjea2003svatah]. My own interpretation gives a role to pragmatic considerations; cf. also [@bhatt1962epistemology].

### Validity as truth

A popular interpretation of Kumarila’s thesis has been this: cognitions are true unless shown otherwise.[^27] (Alternatively, validity may only *entail* truth.) K. K. Dixit, who adopts this interpretation, responds as one might then expect:

[^27]: Assuming a correspondence understanding of truth. Scholars of Indian philosophy often use ‘truth’ as a label of convenience, and thus may describe Kumārila’s thesis in these terms without subscribing to the interpretation now under consideration.

>   the difficulty with Kumārila’s argumentation is that a piece of cognition >   not proved to be invalid is not necessarily valid, it might be valid but it >   might as well be otherwise.[^28]

[^28]: [@dixit1983slokavarttika]; for validity as truth see also e.g. [@chatterjea2003svatah], and [@hiriyanna1932outlines]; among traditional authors see e.g. Gangeśa, *PV* [CITE]. [@bhatt1962epistemology] interprets validity as truth-entailing, but understands intrinsicality in a way that would avoid Dixit’s complaint; classically, cf. Umbeka *SVVT* [CITE].

That would indeed seem to settle the matter. But this is an uncharitable interpretation, and is anyway at odds with the text. Kumārila several times allows that a false cognition may be valid.[^29]

[^29]: For example v. 6 (Jhā’s translation): “Even the unauthoritative Means would, by itself, lead to the conception of its object, and its function could not cease unless its falsity were ascertained by other means.” Cf. e.g. vv. 85–6.

### Taber on intrinsic validity

John Taber has defended another interpretation, the basic lines of which he attributes to Pārthasārathimiśra, another Mīmāmsā commentator.[^30] According to Taber, validity is not truth but rather as it were *committment:* thus “every cognition is accompanied by an initial sense of conviction; one is initially inclined to believe of every cognition that it is true.”[^31] But Taber rightly allows that Kumārila is concerned not only with psychology but also with what is *reasonable*. Verse 60 tells us that when a cognition is not undermined, then “there is no reasonable ground for doubt.”[^32] So we are supposed to be *right* in accepting our beliefs as a guide to how things actually are. “In the end,” says Taber (to give a fuller version of the quote just above),

[^30]:  

[^31]: p. 216; cf. p. 210. [@arnold2001ivrarnold2001ivs] is broadly supportive of the Taber-Pārthasārathi interpretation. For other suggestions in terms of presumptive or *prima facie* truth see [@keith1921karma], [@dasgupta1957history], who offers a coherentist spin, and [@bhatt1962epistemology]. [@chatterjea2003svatah] and [@mohanty1989gangesa] also suggest that—at least in Pārthasārathi’s case—the claim is a psychological one. On Pārthasārathi’s interpretation cf. [@chatterjea2003svatah] and [@bhatt1962epistemology].

[^32]: Cf. *TS* 2872–4, noted by Taber.

>   it appears that Kumārila adopts a common sense position. Every cognition is >   accompanied by an initial sense of conviction; one is initially inclined to >   believe of every cognition that it is true. One continues to be so inclined >   as long as the cognition is not called into question. Almost certainly, >   however, if the cognition is never overturned, it *is* true. Falsehood >   cannot conceal itself forever. If, over the long run, the cognition is not >   shown to be false, then on the basis of its initial, intrinsic validity one >   is certainly *justified* in believing that it is not false, that it is >   really true.[^33]

[^33]: p. 216.

This, for Taber, shows Kumārila adopting a kind of hard-headed empiricism: one may believe only that for which one has evidence; but in addition, to have *no* evidence for something (to have no evidence that your view is wrong, for example) is to be warranted in thinking that no such evidence exists.[^34] To ask for more is in any case futile, since the demand only leads to regress.

[^34]: pp. 205, 216.

Taber’s is one of the most sympathetic and careful interpretations of Kumārila on intrinsic validity, and there is much to like about it. But how can we take seriously the idea that a cognition never undermined is “almost certainly” true, a view that Taber says is “common sense”? Dixit’s comment seems apt again: it might be true and then again it might not. Suppose, for instance, that, from a distance, I mistake for a woman a man whom I am unlikely to encounter again, and would not recognize if I did. How is the passage of time likely to help me see my error? Taber himself raises roughly the same worry about Kumrila’s defense of the Vedas, namely that they seem to come out unscathed only by default.[^35] The problem is more general, as my example shows, and it is also a more general problem about practical life: it’s often hard to know whether one has acted well. I could not possibly have a general expectation that advice—to buy fair-trade coffee, say—will, if bad, always be recognized as such.[^36]

[^35]: p. 217.

[^36]: A complicating factor here is the Mīmāmsā adherence to the view (very contentious in the Indian setting) that ‘absence’ (*abhāva*)is a sound means of acquiring knowledge. That is, one may rightly infer from the absence of any indication of something that it doesn’t exist. But this principle makes no appeal to the passage of time, and Kumārila is liberal and reasonable about what counts as an indication of a real or potential difficulty about evidence. Taber does not rely on an appeal to *abhāva* in his defense of *svatah prāmānya*.

The difficulty here is also particularly acute given Taber’s view that *all* cognitions are intrinsically valid, barring the surfacing of some reason for doubt. On Taber’s understanding, *every judgement* has *prima facie* justification or warrant. There is no good reason, on view, why a judgment should not be warranted, even if it’s formed on the basis of a dream or wishful thinking. Taber may say that Kumārila’s defense of the Vedas is unsuccessful because it makes Vedic injunctions valid just by default, but that’s tantamount to an objection to the *svatah prāmānya* thesis itself, on Taber’s interpretation thereof. The whole *point* would be to make cognitions justified by default, despite the fact that many types and instances of judgements—including quite empirical judgements—cannot be supposed likely to be corrected if faulty.[^37]

[^37]: Taber (p. 215, n. 56) cites v. 80 in support of the idea that the passage of time improves confidence, but while the verse shows that Kumārila is trying to make more than a psychological point, I cannot see in it any indication that he is thinking about the passage of time, except in the trivial sense that a counter-indicating cognition would come after the initial cognition. Taber also adduces *TS* 2904, but again I see in that verse only the claim that cognitions are valid if they’re not upset by other cognitions. Kumārila refers in this verse to cognitions occurring at “other times and places,” but that doesn’t mean that length of time (or travel experience, for that matter) makes a difference to warrant except insofar as counter-indication cognitions would, by their nature, have to occur at other times.[tabertextual]

Taber interpretation draws attention to crucial but often overlooked features of Kumārila’s epistemology, including the lack of coincidence between truth and validity, the importance of warrant or justification. But Taber does not explain how warrant enters the picture; the interpretation falls into the same trap that Pārthasārathi’s does, and which other scholars have noted in that context: the theory reduces to a theory of judgement.[^38] Taber’s has provided an argument for his claim that a cognition “compels our assent”[^39] only if that means merely that judgment *entails* assent. We are offered no reason to suppose that it would be unreasonable simply to stop believing something upon realizing that one doe believe it but can see no particular evidence supporting that belief. Since Kumārila explicitly draws that conclusion[^40]—and Taber himself acknowledges the importance of the point—Taber’s attempted defense of Kumārila’s epistemology must be judged a failure. Moreover, while Taber is right to say that the [*svatah pramanya*] thesis is separable from the doctrine of Vedic authority, the thesis is plainly motivated in great part by a desire to defend, in effect, the possibility of moral knowledge.[^41] Even if there are independent arguments—from the threat of regress, most obviously—it does not seem to me that we do Kumārila’s view much of a service if the realm of knowledge of most interest to him fares least well on his own epistemological theory. Besides which, it is hard to imagine that Kumārila would rest his thesis on the idea that the passage of time makes a judgement more likely to be correct when this line of thought so clearly could not, *in principle*, apply to the Vedic case, and which, indeed, would make validity *extrinsic* in an obvious sense, since it would accrue with time. But Taber’s interpretation relies on this claim, for which the textual evidence is ambiguous at best.[^42]

[^41]: [CITES.]

[^42]: See n. [tabertextual].

Nevertheless, Taber *does* draw attention to important and neglected points in Kumārila’s thought. By drawing out yet more critical features of the view, I believe it is possible to show that Kumārila’s view is genuinely compelling.

Interpretative Constraints --------------------------

Two points in particular will help in constructing a better interpretation. The first stems from a bit of a puzzle. So far as the above interpretations go, it sounds like just any thought or belief whatever is supposed to be possessed of validity. Taber, for example, insists quite explicitly that *all* cognitions are valid, unless sublated or otherwise brought into doubt by some further cognition.[^43] And that is a common reading of Kumārila. But the Mīmāmsās, like other schools, provide a list of the sources of knowledge or valid cognition—for the Mīmāmsās the list includes, among other things, perception, inference, and testimony.[^44] But what is the need for such a list if every belief is automatically valid? In fact Kumārila does *not* think that every cognition is valid—mere fancies or wishful thoughts, for example, are not valid.[^45] In fact, Kumārila notably excludes memorial judgements from the realm of validity—only cognitions or judgments with novel contents are apt for validity.[^46] And also memories are, on Kumārila’s view, generally recognizable as such,[^47] we don’t always obvious whether a judgment is memorial, since on the Mimamsa view mistaken judgements—say formed as a result of a dream—are effectively memorial events or collocations of memorial elements.[^48] So we cannot say that every judgement has intrinsic validity, or that any commitment we have is warranted barring some counter-indication. So we’ll need to find a way to understand how cognitions can be *intrinsically* valid without severing the connection between *valid sources of cognitions* and *valid cognitions*.

[^43]: p. [XX].

[^46]: *SV* II.22–3, V.11.

[^47]: [CITE - CHECK BHATT 90–3]

[^48]: [SL CITE]; [SECONDARY CITE].

The second point is this. The Mīmāmsās are strict about the distinguishing the mental state which provides some awareness of the world (I will call this a first-order cognition) from the mental state which provides awareness of that first-order cognition (I’ll call this the second-order cognition).[^49] In some schools of Indian thought, one cognition can serve both roles: awareness is itself present to consciousness as it reveals its object. Not so in Mīmāmsā.[^50] But the implications of this point for the *svatah prāmānya* thesis have not been properly appreciated. In effect, we have *two* theses.[^51] One thesis concerns the status of the first-order cognition, and the second concerns the apprehension of that status by a second-order cognition.

[^50]: See [@sen1984concept] for discussion.

[^51]: cf. [@chatterjea2003svatah].

In my view the failure to appreciate point is partly responsible for the failure to appreciate the first. Tara Chatterjea, for example, though observing that the *svatah prāmānya* thesis is really two theses, says that Kumārila makes “contradictory suggestions” concerning the scope of the *svatah prāmānya* thesis, and identifies v. 53 as apparently claiming that *all* cognitions are intrinsically valid, in contrast with e.g. v.47 which says only that *valid* cognitions are intrinsically valid.[^52] (Taber also relies on v. 53 in claiming that all cognitions are valid.[^53]) But if v. 47 concerns the status of a cognition while v. 53 concerns the *assessement of* the status of a cognition, then that is too quick. It might be, for example, that only some cognitions are valid, but that every cognition, when apprehended, is apprehended as (i.e.  taken to be?) valid. We may thus hope that care regarding these two points will make an adequate interpretation possible.

Kumārila on Intrinsic Validity ==============================

After describing my interpretation of Kumārila’s *svatah prāmānya* thesis, in §3.1, in §3.2, interpretation in hand, I work through a portion of the *Codanāsūtra*.

The interpretation in outline. ------------------------------

‘Validity’ has, for Kumārila, as for most Indian philosophers, both a causal or psychological aspect and also a normative aspect; in India, as in the West, different understandings of perception were taken to have implications concerning what we can know, and epistemological commitments motivated views about mind and perception.

Beginning with the psychological side, consider the idea, common in the history of philosophy, that experience confronts us with certain *appearances* (or *ideas* or *impressions* (though these appearances need not always be pictoral or visual in nature). One may hope that these appearances at least sometimes resemble or represent the world in some way. Locke, for example, thought that they sometimes did, and that we could sometimes be confident of this; the Stoics had a comparable view. Certain ancient skeptics thought that indeed our impressions *might* resemble or represent the world, but they argued that we can never *know* whether, and should not believe that, they do. And then Hume and Kant, in different ways, decided that the whole question was nonsense. Parallel positions existed in India concerning what we have called ‘cognitions.’ As in the early modern case, skepticism was more threat than reality, but Locke, Hume and Kant have their counterparts among Naiyāyikas, Buddhists, and idealists. Thus far, then, we might think of cognitions as being roughly equivalent to appearances or impressions.

Now one might think of cognitions or appearances offer themselves for acceptance or assent, or, equally, for rejection. This is the view of some of Kumārila’s opponents; hence an objection considered by Kumārila to the effect that cognitions do *not* present themselves as *authoritative*.[^54] Now Taber says that “the intrinsic validity of cognitions is vested for the Mīmāmsaka in the sense of conviction with which they typically arise.”[^55] And it is right that, for Kumārila, in a cognition, the subject is not simply presented with a view or thought which he might or equally well might *not* accept as his own. To form the cognition is indeed, as Taber says, *already* to view the world in the way portrayed by the cognition. But this does not go far enough. The problem is that, in Kamārila’s case, the language of *portrayal* is out of place altogether; so also, I think, is Taber’s willingness to make use of the language of appearances, as does when he sees in Kumārila “a kind of rigid philosophical realism which insists strictly on the reality of appearances,” and when he says that the “emphasis on the inability to distinguish true from false cognitions expresses what seems an almost skeptical attitude on the part of Kumarila, viz., that we can never establish with absolute certainty that a cognition corresponds with reality.”[^56]

[^54]: v. 85.

[^55]: [@taber2002mo]; cf. [@taber1987review]: validity “is inherent insofar as it is vested in the essential ‘presenting’ nature of cognition.”

[^56]: 2, p. 206; 215; cf. pp. 207, 216, 218, 221.

Consider on the one hand a (representational) painting. One may appreciate it without supposing that what is represented there ever existed elsewhere. For most of us, on the other hand, a photograph or recording invites us to suppose that we are getting a bit of a glimpse of another time and place. Indeed it might be only when something seems off about the photograph that we feel the need to inspect it more carefully—when what is displayed seems very improbable, say, or when a face on the cover of a magazine is suspiciously free of wrinkles. But Kumārila’s cognitions are not like paintings *or* photographs. A photograph, like a painting, is something we examine it its own right, and which we may call into question. But, as was pointed out above—and this is uncontroversial—Kumārila does not believe that cognitions are items to be inspected in their own right. A better analogy for Kumārila’s cognitions would be a (very clean) *window*. The existence of a cognition is *inferred* from what is shown us by it, just as we may realize that there is a mirror or a window at the end of a hall because we see *ourselves* there at the end of the hall, or buildings beyond it.[^57]

[^57]: *SV* [CITES]. Compare the familiar idea that, in order to figure out what one believes, one looks, as it were, not *inward*, but *outward*, towards the world.

### Intrinsic validity as a psychological thesis.

It was noted earlier that the ‘intrinsic validity’ thesis is really *two* theses, one about a first-order cognition and one about a second-order cognition. There are likewise two aspects of the thesis still considered as a psychological thesis. First, as regards the first-order cognition, the claim is that it is the nature of cognitions to provide a *window on* the world, rather than a *picture of* it—to have a cognition *just is*, at least in the basic case, to have a view of the world; it is not something that can be inspected itself. Regarding the second-order case, the point is that one reads (it’s a matter of inference) the existence of the first-order cognition off of the portion of the world thus revealed (you see the buildings through the window, and because you can see buildings you may infer that there is a window). The first-order cognition does not become an object of thought directly; it can be contemplated, indirectly as it were, without, as it were, *stepping back from the cognition*, or without regarding the cognition as something now in question, or as something which might now be rejected, since it is the very having of the view that makes it possible to recognize the cognition.[^58]

[^58]: We must leave aside the details of Kumārila’s theory of perception, which would also take us into his metaphysics and philosophy of language, but a translation of the relevant chapter of the *SL* (the *Pratyaksapariccheda*) has recently been offered, along with extensive notes and discussion, by [@taber2005hindu].

Kumārila also claims that *invalidity* is *extrinsic*. Remember that validity does not entail truth or accuracy. If cognitions manifest the world rather than representing it, Kumārila nevertheless thinks that cognitions may err in various ways. We might again compare a window, which, even if very clean, so that we cannot inspect it directly, may be warped or tinted so that although we see the world through it and not in it, we see the world through it *wrongly*. The thesis that invalidity is extrinsic emphasizes the point that even when a cognition portrays the world wrongly, we cannot consider it directly and note features of that cognition that are misleading, the way you could point out parts of a photo that may mislead. What you can do is *form new cognitions*, and these may reveal that earlier cognitions were defective. (Kumārila identifies two cases. First there is the case where you directly apprehend something as being different than you had thought: this is like looking out a new window, seeing that it’s bright outside, and realizing that the first window had been tinted. Second there is the case where you realize that the first cognition was formed in some defective way: this is like being told that the windows are tinted and realizing it’s brighter out than you thought.)[^59]

[^59]: [@kataoka2002validity] outlines the structure of invalidity; cf. [@bhatt1962epistemology].

But the extrinsic invalidity thesis, still regarded as a psychological thesis, may again be divided into two parts, regarding first- and second-order cognitions respectively. First, since there is nothing in a cognition itself which could indicate a problem with it, a problem can only be indicated by another cognition, or by something turned up by another cognition (either because it reveals the world differently or because it reveals that the first cognition was formed in a problematic way). And second, for the very same reason, one can only *recognize* a problem with a cognition on the basis of what is turned up by some further cognition. The difference between the two cases is that, in the first case, one might never even notice that one had possessed a cognition that was problematic; you might simply have adopted a new view without ever noticing an evolution in your thinking, for example, or you might wind up holding onto inconsistent views (in which case you would not, of course, have yet actually given up. In the second case, the new cognition becomes your new way of seeing the world; to see the old cognition as defective (as invalid) is already to have set it aside.

So again, on my interpretation of *svatah prāmānya* we must actually distinguish between the capacity of a cognition to manifest the world (whether accurately or not) and validity. They are not the same, nor are validity and manifestation always found together. Now Kumārila frequently appeals to the fact that a cognition is present and manifesting the world in a certain way as a reason for saying that cognitions are intrinsically valid,[^60] and this has no doubt contributed to the thought that manifestation and validity are the same thing. But Kumārila also says that even invalid cognitions can manifest the world, at least until the error is noticed.[^61] This point seems to have been overlooked (i.e. by interpreters who think that *all* cognitions are—at least initially—valid) primarily on account of a failure to distinguish the first- and second-order cases.[^62] Kumārila assumes that once an error has been acknowledged, the erroneous cognition is set aside; thus a cognition will manifest the world in a certain way until it is recognized to be invalid. Thus it has been supposed that validity and manifestation go hand in hand. But that conflates the first- and second-order theses. A cognition could continue to manifest the world a certain way even after its invalidity has been revealed, if that invalidity has not been noticed. And there is another way that manifestation may come apart from validity. It is only cognitions derived from certain sources that count as valid: in particular valid cognitions derive from valid modes of knowledge.[^63] But you could see the world some way without having a view that is even apt for validity. (Memorial beliefs, for example, are not validity-apt.[^64]) A cognition is intrinsically valid, then, neither in virtue of being accurate nor in virtue of manifesting (or pretending to manifest) the world. A cognition is intrinsically valid when it constitutes a genuine (though perhaps distorted) window on the world, in virtue of having a psychological or causal basis which allows it to be such a window. Cognitions arising from another source, however much they present or seem to present the world, and however accurately they do so, are not and cannot be valid, intrinsically or otherwise.

[^60]: See e.g. vv. 6, 47, 85.

[^61]: v. 85, cf. vv. 25, 94–5 [XX].

[^62]: The other factor is perhaps the failure to see the connection between the validity of means of knowledge and the validity of cognitions. See §[constraints] above and §[textualinterpretation] below.

[^63]: See [constraints] above.

[^64]: *SV* [CITE].

### Intrinsic validity as a normative thesis.

Although Kumārila generally describes cognitions and validity in psychological or causal terms, he takes his account to have (what we would consider) normative implications.[^65] We can indeed consider Kumārila’s thesis to have a normative or evaluative aspect.

[^65]: See n. [reasonableness] above.

On the normative side, then, we may consider validity as the status a cognition has when one is rationally entitled to it: I’ll call it *warrant* or *entitlement*. And we can again split this into two points, one regarding the first-order cognition, and the other a second-order cognition. For the first-order case, the claim is that the warrant of a cognition does not depend on its being buttressed by further cognitions. (Thus, for example, if you read in the *Times* that Hirut is beautiful, and come to believe that Hirut is beautiful, this belief does not require, for its warrant, that you have any other supporting belief, for example that the *Times* is a reliable source.) Second, one may realize that one possesses no evidence (or further supporting beliefs) for some belief without being rationally required to suspend or abandon that belief. Indeed, barring undermining evidence, it is irrational to reject your beliefs. (So, for example, suppose you realize that you believe Hirut is beautiful, but can’t remember how it is that you came by that belief. If you’re reasonable, and barring some more definite source of doubt, you will stand by this belief regardless.) To say that invalidity is extrinsic again means two things. First, a warranted cognition loses that warrant when some further cognition undermines it. (The belief that Hirut is beautiful will lose its warrant if you read that the reporter has been fabricating stories.) Second, a cognition is properly adjudged unwarranted when you can see that there is something to undermine it.

However, a cognition is not simply warranted *by default.* The warrant of a *warranted* cognition is intrinsic in the sense described. But to have that status in the first place depends on the causal or psychological origin of the cognition. Hence the list of ‘valid’ *sources* of cognition, or warrant-conveying sources of cognition. Thus a cognition arrived at through testimony, inference, perception, or other sound basis of knowledge is warranted—though it may not be *correct*, since not every belief derived from perception (for example) is in fact veridical. A cognition originating merely in a dream, for instance, was never warranted in the first place, though it may very well masquerade as a valid cognition, and as a cognition from a good source.

How are the psychological and the normative aspects of *svatah prāmānya* related? We may note first that it’s characteristic of the Indian tradition to (as we would see it) transform normative or evaluative questions into epistemological or metaphysical questions, so far as possible. Notoriously there seems to have been virtually no direct philosophical inquiry into final ends—no ethics or moral philosophy in the Western sense. The introduction has already given an illustration of the kind of thing that happened instead: debates about final ends were fought by proxy, ramifying out into epistemology, ontology, perception, language, and so on, with each school developing an increasingly sophisticated philosophical apparatus to buttress their approach to duty or liberation. And in our present case, it’s quite unsurprising that there should be a normative or evaluative side to the intrinsic validity thesis, since, as a psychological theses, it offers resistance to the idea that some objects should stand between ourselves and the world, an idea that the Mīmāmsā plainly felt led to skepticism.[^66]

[^66]: See further [@sen1984concept]. Of course this sort of thing is familiar in the West as well.

And that is Kumārila’s strategy. In his view, the various *pramānas* are ways of opening up windows (in the form of cognitions) on the world. They don’t merely represent it, but reveal it. This is what distinguishes the *pramānas* from other sources of cognition such as wishful thinking or dreams—also, in Kumārila’s view, even from memory, which is parasitic on genuine *pramānas*. But then it would be a mistake to distance yourself from your cognitions, as if they merely *represented* the world, or as if in looking around your surroundings you were only looking at something in your own head. A confused philosophical perspective on these matters leads to skepticism—it did so, or was thought to, in India as in the West—and a clear view ought to ward off that skepticism. Now of course sometimes you’re wrong about things—Kumārila doesn’t pretend otherwise. One often learns this in the ordinary course of things, as when one gets a closer view or a view in better light. But it is because cognitions open up the world to us the way they do that allows us to correct ourselves in that manner.

Kumarila’s claim that cognitions are grasped as valid—the second-order intrinsic validity thesis—gives the impression that Kumārila is trying to just help himself to evidence. But we are in a position to see that grasping a cognition as being valid corresponds more closely to *reasonably believing something in a conscious and occurrent manner* than it does to *believing that a belief is reasonable.* The latter—believing that a belief is reasonable—looks like it ought generally to be a response to some kind of evidence one can marshall regarding the belief in question or its content. But that kind of reflective attention involved in *evaluating* a belief is different from the reflective attention involved in simply *exploring* one’s beliefs. Consider the familiar idea that, in order to figure out what one believe, one looks *outward* towards the world—or the world as one sees it. If I’m asked whether Hirut is beautiful (or whether I believe that she is), and supposing this time that I’ve seen her at some point, then I’ll think back to what she looked like, or try to frame her image in my mind, and then say “yes” or “no” depending on what I see there. There need be no question in this case of assessing evidence in any ordinary sense, or of, say, reviewing the visual conditions under which I first saw her. This is the case Kumārila is concerned with. And Kumārila’s claim then seems fair enough. This kind of reflection just assumes the reasonableness of the original belief, and it’s hard to see how else it could be. In Kumārila’s view there is no need to be concerned with the further question about the basis of one’s beliefs, so far as no particular cause for concern arises; indeed, if there were such cause for concern, you could never answer this simple question about whether Hirut is beautiful if the moment you thought back on Hirut your earlier cognitions of her must be open to question. Compare J. L. Austin on demanding how one knows:

>   If you say ’That’s not enough’, then you must have in mind some more or less >   definite lack. ’To be a goldfinch, besides having a red head it must also >   have the characteristic eye-markings’: or ’How do you know it isn’t a >   woodpecker? Woodpeckers have red heads too’. If there is no definite lack, >   which you are at least prepared to specify on being pressed, then it ’s >   silly (outrageous) just to go on saying ’That’s not enough’.[^67]

[^67]: [@austin1961other].

That also helps us to make sense of the idea that *all* cognitions may be taken as valid just in virtue of being cognitions. Sure enough, not every cognition *is* valid. But accepting it as valid doesn’t *make* anything valid, either: Kumarila’s does not think that reflection renders a cognition valid any more that it renders cognition invalid; nor does taking a cognition to be valid in any way *establish* that it is valid, or even imply that any evidence favors that cognitions, unless it’s what’s manifested in that cognition already. It does not mean that warrant or evidence has *accrued*. To put the point differently, we might say that Kumārila is interested rather in *being* justified than in *having* a justification.

Again, Kumārila’s view is that reasonable belief does not *require* inquiry into evidence; it is not his view that there is anything *wrong* with such inquiry. We saw above that Taber attributed to Kumarila the idea that if no contrary evidence comes up then there must not be any. But in fact Kumarila’ need only claim that, absent problematic evidence, one is not rationally required to suspend or reject belief.

There is no willful blindness in the approach, thought the Mīmāmsās’ larger aim of defending Vedic authority may create that impression. Kumarila view is not that testimony (for instance) ought always to be accepted unquestioningly. There are sorts of reasons for distrusting testimony, or the deliverances of any other cognitions-forming mechanism for that matter. Kumarila gives no ground to skepticism—the fact is that quite often we know or can easily know plenty about the various ways we form our beliefs and about when further investigation is required. Kumarila is not confronting the skeptical worry that we can never get outside our own beliefs to see how well they fit the world by saying baldly that we just *can* accept our beliefs as generally sound. He is, rather, refusing to allow the skeptical worries to set the agenda at all.

Working through the text. -------------------------

As noted earlier, the *Codanāsūtra* is a commentary on *MS* I.i.2, which says that “duty is a purpose having injunction for its sole authority.” A number of the initial verses of the *CS* are concerned with minor clarifications of this thesis, but vv. 5–6 are close to a statement of the chapter’s main theses:

>   5. Inasmuch as authoritative character [regarding duty] is possible only to >   the Word, [Śābara] has also pointed out the incapacity, with regard to such >   objects [necessary for knowledge of duty], of Sense-Perception and the rest, >   which is to be described hereafter. 6. Even with regard to purely >   non-existing objects, the Word brings about some conception. And >   consequently, in the absence of any discrepancy, authoritative character >   must be accepted to belong to it by its very nature.[^68]

[^68]: Jhā refers to ‘cognitions’ as ‘conceptions’; ‘validity’ is ‘authoritativeness’; \`intrinsic is ‘inherent’; Jhā also uses ‘means of right notion’ to refer to a valid cognition.

The latter parts of the *CS* are concerned more directly with the role and value of testimony as opposed to the other sources of knowledge mentioned here in v. 5, and the earlier portions (up to around v. 102) focus more on the the general epistemological theses indicated in v. 6.

The latter verse picks up on a common Mīmāmsā theme, namely the independence of testimony as a source of knowledge:[^69] testimony produces cognitions, including of things non-existent, hence which could not have been produced by sense perception—and thus is a *primitive* producer of cognitions—and so it is a *pramāna*. Now this seems rather problematic in a few ways. On the one hand Kumārila will not want to count just anything as a *pramāna* merely because it leads us to think things. But if the point is rather (as I think it is) that testimony can (at least in the case of Vedic testimony regarding duty) provide us with a window on things that other *pramānas* cannot, then the claim will be question-begging. But this is only a preliminary statement of the view (and fortunately we are not concerned with the case of testimony specifically), so we may simply note that a cognition-producing mechanism is *eo ipso* a valid mechanism, i.e. a producer of *valid* cognitions.

[^69]: See §1 above.

The starting-point for the discussion of *svatah prāmānya* is an objection to the Mīmāmsās doctrine that an authorless text is our authority on *dharma*, the nub of which objection Kumārila presents himself:

>   22. It is always an object perceived by other means of knowledge that is got >   at by the Word [testimony]; and, like memory, no authority can belong to it >   by itself.

When one accepts testimony, it is because “it is an assertion of a person who is believed to have perceived the object.”[^70] In other words, testimony is not a primitive source of knowledge like perception or inference are, and the objector adds that we sometimes disregard testimony when we *don’t* judge the source reliable—but how could that be, if a reliable source isn’t in fact essential to testimony as a source of knowledge?[^71] The opponent also makes the objection I worried about a moment ago:

[^70]: v. 23.

[^71]: v. 30.

>   25. “Thus then, as even when producing a conception, Fancy, &c., are no >   authorities by themselves, so we may apply the same rule to the case of Veda >   also.”

So, again, we do not want to say that just any psychological mechanism which produces some judgment is therefore to be accorded authority.

Kumārila responds by broadening the inquiry, turning away from the specific case of testimony:

>   33. With regard to all conceptions, you must consider the following >   question: “Is the authoritativeness or unauthoritativeness due to itself or >   to something else?”

There are three possible positions besides Kumārila’s own:

>   34. Because those that are by themselves false cannot by any means be proved >   to be true. Some people attribute both (authoritativeness and its contrary) >   to (the conception) itself. Others attribute them to the proved excellences >   or discrepancies of its origin.

In the first sentence Kumārila briefly hints at his reason for rejecting the view that invalidity is intrinsic and validity extrinsic—he will return to it at v. 38ff. That leaves the possibility that both validity *and* invalidity might be intrinsic to cognitions, or that both might be extrinsic to cognitions. The next verses are devoted to rejecting these possibilities. Regarding the first possibility, Kumārila says that

>   35. Both cannot be due to itself, because the two are mutually >   contradictory….

>   36. How can it be possible that any one thing, independent of all extraneous >   agency, should have contradictory characters? …

>   37. If “non-contradictoriness” were possible with regard to different >   conceptions—even then, if nothing else is taken into consideration, it >   cannot be ascertained which is which, and where.

We might, uncharitably, see the argument of vv. 35–6 as turning on a confusion of type and token—why shouldn’t some cognitions have the one character and other cognitions the other? Verse 37 would then acknowledge the confusion and offer a better argument. But that would be an unhelpful procedure, and v. 36 offers some textual basis for rejecting this reading. Verse 36 asks not just how cognitions could have contradictory characters, but specifically how anything could have contradictory characters *independently of all extraneous agency.* If we were talking about a single cognition it would not matter whether or not extraneous agencies were implicated—a single thing could not be valid and invalid at the same time regardless. That suggests that even in vv. 35–6 Kumārila has in mind cognitions in general rather than particular cognitions—some cognitions will be valid and some invalid but the difference has to be explained by further, external factors.

Why should we have to appeal to extraneous factors to explain the difference? And what is the real objection in vv. 35–6 to the possibility that both validity and invalidity might be intrinsic? A reasonable possibility is that Kumārila thinks that either validity or invalidity should be in some sense *natural* to conceptions. But then *only one or the other* could be natural to cognitions in general, not both. Thus if validity were natural or intrinsic to cognitions then the invalidity of a given cognition would require some further explanation appealing to extrinsic factors. This interpretation would fit the language employed in the string of objections that are shortly posed. Thus 38: “for those that hold the authoritativeness of conceptions to be natural…”; v. 40: “if authoritativeness were inherent or natural…”; v. 44: “while unauthoritativeness, being natural….” So it seems reasonable to say, on the basis of vv. 35–6, that, for Kumārila, the question of the intrinsic or extrinsic nature of validity or invalidity is a question about the natural state of cognitions in general, the point then being that there could be (at most) only one such natural state. And that seems a natural view to hold if the questions is in part a question as to whether cognitions are presentative or rather *re*presentative.[^72]

[^72]: See §[interpoutline] above.

But in v. 37 Kumārila seems to set aside the inquiry into cognitions in general. Now he does consider the possibility that cognitions should be considered individually. Might some then be intrinsically valid and others invalid, just as there are both natural redheads and natural blondes? Kumārila now objects that “it cannot be ascertained which is which, and where.” The idea, I think, is this. Focussing on the psychological side of the issue, the suggestion at hand is that some cognitions are presentative in nature and others representative.[^73] But since the question has implications for the question of warrant—there remains an open question about the accuracy of a representation which does not arise in the case of a presentation—then the suggestion being considered in v. 37 is effectively a suggestion that sometimes a cognition *arrives* warranted, as it were, while other times a cognition is warranted only if supported or certified by another cognition. The “which is which and where” objection seems very much to the point then, the thought being that this suggestion undermines the possibility of intrinsic validity altogether—for how could you be warranted in accepting the intrinsically warranted cognitions if you can’t tell them apart from the ones that need to be certified by appeal to another cognition? A cognition that requires either buttressing or discarding must be discarded if you can’t buttress it; but if you can’t tell the cognitions to which that requirement applies apart from the cognitions to which it doesn’t, how can you be rationally required to stand by the latter, given that for all you need they must be either buttressed or discounted? True, there just could still *be* intrinsically warranted beliefs after all—i.e. cognitions to which you are entitled even if they are not supported by other cognitions. But that entitlement would seem to disappear upon reflection.[^74] The epistemological benefit of understanding cognitions as presentative would thus disappear if it is only in the nature of *some* cognitions or types of cognitions to be presentative.

[^73]: At least that’s how Kumārila, a realist, would look at the matter: Buddhists, for example, who might actually hold the view that both validity and invalidity are extrinsic, will generally think about the matter in very different terms—see §§[interpretativeissues] &[rivalinterpretations] above. It’s not clear that Kumārila is really trying to seriously respond to such views as opposed to just considering all of the possibilities in a realistic spirit. Kumārila’s principal target is evidently the view that validity is extrinsic and invalidity intrinsic

[^74]: At present we are asking a question about the warrant of the first-order cognition, and not a question about how it can be *determined* whether a first-order cognition is warranted. But one part of the suggestion in the contemplated scenario is that some cognitions may be warranted only *if* assessed in a certain way.

The first halves of vv. 35–6 having argued that validity and invalidity cannot both be intrinsic to cognitions, the latter halves of these sections argue that they cannot both be *extrinsic* to cognitions either.

>   35. … Nor can both be due to something else, because in this latter case, >   there would be no definiteness in the conception.

>   36. … And when devoid of both these characters, of what form could the >   conception be?

it looks like Kumārila has here restricted his attention to individual cognitions, so if ‘being devoid of both characters’ would mean that a cognition would be neither presentative nor representative, neither warranted nor unwarranted, then it’s unsurprising that Kumārila would dismiss this possibility. This seems to be confirmed when we look at what Kumārila means by saying that these cognitions would lack ‘form’ or ‘definiteness.’ We may for example consider v. 168, which comes in the course of a discussion of sentence meaning and the importance of reliable speakers:

>   168. Though the meaning [of a sentence] may have been comprehended >   beforehand, yet it depends for its definiteness upon the fact of its >   originating directly from the [trustworthy] speaker’s cognition; hence such >   a fact can only be comprehensible through the comprehension of the meaning. >   But in the matter of authenticity, it takes the first place.

This seems to say that while *understanding* a sentence is simply a matter of sentence meaning, definiteness and authenticity (ie. validity) are a matter of the source of the belief in question. In any case the “definiteness” of a cognition seems to depend somehow on the causal origin of that cognition. What would that mean? It seems plausible to suppose that Kumārila is gesturing at the difference between *merely* having a thought for just whatever reason, and having a thought that is delivered by some belief-producing mechanism which lends it weight. (Specifically, for Kumārila, these will be cognition-producing mechanisms.[^75]) One might for example just entertain the thought “Hirut is beautiful.” This thought does not offer itself for acceptance or rejection—nothing *asserts* Hirut’s beauty, as it were. Alternatively one might *read* that Hirut is beautiful, which in effect presents Hirut to you as beautiful. In this case the thought would be “definite.”

[^75]: Cf. [@sen1984concept] and eg. *SV* IV.v.78.

Considered form the perspective of warrant, the proposal is arguing against is that a cognition is warranted only if you can buttress it with some other cognition; and moreover the cognition is only unwarranted if it is undermined by some other cognition. Now suppose that were true. Now you are reading a newspaper, and you read that a certain Hirut is beautiful. And suppose you have no particular reason for doubting this or for distrusting the newspaper. But you can only rationally adopt the belief that Hirut is beautiful if you can ground it in some other cognition. But also you can only reject it if you can oppose it with some other cognition. But then in what sense could this report be offering itself to you for acceptance, if you could accept it only by checking somewhere else for support first, but at the same time can’t rationally reject it either? Of course we could say that the newspaper is just offering you some things for consideration, but this would be exactly Kumārila’s point: you might just as well have spent your morning daydreaming, if that’s all reading the newspaper gets you. The big question is whether validity is intrinsic and invalidity extrinsic, as Kumārila thinks, or the other way round. Verses 38–46 set out the position of Kumārila’s opponent, and some of the opponent’ reasons for saying that invalidity is intrinsic and validity extrinsic. One objection to Kumārila’s view is offered in v. 40:

>   40. “If authoritativeness were inherent or natural and its absence >   artificial, then dream-cognitions would be authoritative, self-supported; >   for what is there to refute this?”

This is nearly a restatement of the objection of v. 25 within the new dialectical context—we have shifted from the case of *modes of knowledge* to the case of *cognitions*. Kumārila had claimed that testimony (and thus Vedic testimony) is a source of knowledge on the ground that it produces cognitions, and in v. 25 the opponent says that cognitions are produced by many other (and plainly more problematic) mechanisms as well. Certainly from the perspective of warrant, the opponent’s view is intuitive: the thought is that, given all the defective ways cognitions can be formed, one can be warranted in thinking something only if one can recognize that one came by that thought in some sound way. My confidence in what I think about this or that should be affected, for example, by whether I read it in the *National Enquirer* or on Wikipedia or in the *NYRB*, and that requires that I should have some appreciation of how my views originated.

But Kumārila’s response is also intuitive:

>   49–51. If even on the birth of conception, the object thereof be not >   comprehended until the purity of its cause has been ascertained by other >   means, then in all cases we should have to wait for the production of >   another conception from a new source; for until its purity has been >   ascertained, the conception would be equal to nothing. And this second >   conception too, would be true only on the ascertainment of the purity of its >   cause; and so on and on, there would be no limit.

The opponent thinks that the soundness of your view should turn on your appreciation of the soundness of the origins of your view—but to this sort of verification there is no end, for how can you trust that you have indeed properly assessed the origins of your original view?[^76] Your assessment itself might be wrong, and indeed according the opponent the assessment itself should be in doubt until verified. At that rate we will never be entitled to confidence about anything.[^77]

[^76]: Cf. [@alston1980level] on “level confusions.”

[^77]: cf. also v. 56.

Though the issue of warrant is obviously important here, Kumārila is more directly making a psychological point, as is especially evident from the two preceding verses.

>   47. You must understand that authoritativeness is inherent in all Means of >   Right Notion. For a faculty, by itself non-existing, cannot possibly be >   brought into existence by any other agency;

>   48. since it is only for the sake of its birth that a positive entity >   requires a cause. And when it has once been born, it’s application to its >   various effects proceeds naturally out of itself.

A valid cognition must of course have some causal basis, but once produced it provides comprehension of its object—that is what I take the reference to ‘facuty’ and ‘application’ to mean. Kumārila thinks that if the validity of a cognition—that, say, Hirut is beautiful—depends on some other cognition, then we would not after all have a comprehension of Hirut being beautiful until such a cognition is available. In line with the interpretation proposed in §[interpoutline] above, I understand the point here as follows. Suppose you pick up a copy of the *New York Times.* In it you read a story about Ethiopia. The story is about a singer named Hirut and it reports that she is beautiful. Now suppose you know essentially nothing about the *Times*, but you have no reason to doubt it or to to doubt it’s reliability in this particular arena (compare asking someone on the street for the time). And in fact you come to believe, as a result of reading the story, that there is an Ethiopian singer named Hirut who is beautiful. In fact the *Times* is reasonably reliable in these matters; the reporter is an honest and careful one, with sound aesthetic sensibilities. Now hasn’t the *Times* opened up a bit of the world for you? Doesn’t your new belief give you a bit of a window on how things are, in particular with regard to Ethiopia and one Ethiopian singer named Hirut? This is what Kumarila claims is the case: a valid cognition is a window on the world, and nothing more than what has been described is required to open up that window.[^78]

[^78]: Compare [@kripke1972naming] on Jonah.

Why does Kumarila say that once it has originated, the cognition thereby acts as this window, and that nothing could make it act as a window if it couldn’t do so of it’s own accord? If we considered the matter in terms of *thoughts* or *beliefs*, this would seem to be a mistake. Suppose another man reads the story about Hirut, but only in a detached fashion, forming no beliefs, because he dismisses the *Times* as a part of the reactionary old-media elite. The report that Hirut is beautiful opens no windows for him. But then he reads that the reporter in question supports some bold progressive cause like open borders, and thus decides he must be a trustworthy sort after all. He now remembers how this reporter said that a certain Hirut was beautiful, and now believes it. Doesn’t the initial thought about Hirut now serve as a window for him, having been thus opened? Here we must remember that Kumarila’s cognitions are not just the same as beliefs as we understand them—or as thoughts, depending on how those are understood. A cognition is anchored to its genetic origin—to the particular episode of receiving testimony or of perceiving that gave rise to the cognition—in a way that a belief is not. Or again, validity, unlike justification, cannot be provided later for a cognition that lacked it. A cognition either captures a view of the world or it doesn’t, and if it doesn’t nothing can change that later. You could later come by a new cognition that gives you what the first one might have, but that will just be a different cognition.

If the validity of a cognition depends on other cognitions, then we’ll have a regress; Kumārila’s view avoids that difficulty:

>   52. In case, however, authoritativeness be accepted to be due to (the >   conception) itself, nothing else is wanted (for its cognition). Because in >   the absence of any cognition of discrepancies, falsity (unauthoritativeness) >   becomes precluded by itself (ie. without the help of any extraneous >   Means).[^79]

[^79]: Cf. v. 56: “The fact of mere Unauthoritativeness being due to discrepancies does not lead to any *regressus ad infinitum*—as is found to be the case with the theory of the cognition of excellences (being the cause of authoritativeness)—for us who hold the theory of “self-evidence” [*svatah prāmānya*].”

Note that Jhā (rightly) glosses ‘falsity’ as ‘unauthoritativeness’ (ie. invalidity). We return to ‘falsity’ in connection with v. 54 below.

Verse 47 above said that validity is intrinsic to all *valid* cognitions. But v. 53 has been cited by Taber to support the view that *all* cognitions are intrinsically valid, and vv. 47 & 53 have adduced by Tara Chatterjea to show that Kumarila’s work contains “contradictory suggestions” concerning the scope of the *svatah prāmānya* thesis.[^80]

[^80]: See §2.3 above.

>   53. Therefore the authoritative character of a conception, cognised through >   the mere fact of its having the character of “cognition,” can be set aside >   only by the contrary nature of its object, or by the recognition of >   discrepancies in its cause.

But while the discussion (mine and Kumārila’s) has thus far primarily concerned the first-order cognition, verses 52–53 connect up the first- and second-order elements of the intrinsic validity thesis. We remember that for Kumārila, a cognition is not—as it would be for other Indian philosophers, or for Descartes, say—itself an object in consciousness, though it manifests some other object to consciousness. If you are aware of a cognition as opposed to its object, that is because it is itself the object of a further cognition. And the *svatah prāmānya* thesis in this connection concerns the further question of the relationship between cognizing a cognition and cognizing that cognition as valid, and it amounts to the claim that a cognition, when apprehended by another cognition, is thereby apprehended *as being valid*.[^81] That is what v. 53 is asserting.

[^81]: [@mohanty1989gangesa] offers a useful note on the difference between (and different positions on) grasping ‘*prakāśa*’ and grasping ‘*prāmānya*,’ and see [@sen1984concept] for a more extensive treatment. [SV CITES]

Why are cognitions apprehended as valid? Because to reflect upon a cognition just is to reflect upon the world which that cognition reveals; the reflection presupposes that the initial cognition constitutes your view of the world. It would be possible, of course, to say that reflection does throw open the matter—that to reflect on a belief is to step back from it, and to now require some new basis for accepting it, if one is to continue to accept it. So suppose that, upon recognizing and attending to the belief that Hirut is beautiful, you were to apprehend it as not valid—whether actually invalid or as somehow neither valid nor invalid. Then that very second-order cognition would undermine the first cognition. Even granting that, up to that point, the initial cognition was valid, there would now be a new cognition to the effect that the first cognition was invalid or false or doubtful or whatever the case may be. Of course this new cognition might itself be invalid, but, by Kumarila’s own theory, that can only be so if some other cognition throws some some specific doubt on *it*. And since there are generally going to be legitimate ways of coming to recognize one’s own cognitions, this condition will often not hold. So reflection will be a way of undermining your cognitions, except to the extent that you are able to identify some support for them. In that case the two forms of the *svatah prāmānya* thesis match nicely, and both are supported by the appeal to the threat of infinite regress. In v. 54 Kumarila identifies several varieties of invalidity:

>   54. Unauthoritativeness is three-fold: as being due to falsity, >   non-perception, and doubt. From among these, two (falsity and doubt) being >   positive entities, are brought about by discrepancies in the cause.

With the reference to ‘positive entities,’ Kumārila responds to qualms of a pan-Indian variety about what sorts of facts or entities ought to be explained in what way; that need not detain us.[^82] The reference to ‘discrepancies’ is more important: the proponent of intrinsic invalidity will claim that a cognition is rendered valid when the mechanisms which produced it are seen to have been sound, whereas Kumārila claims that a cognition is shown invalid when the mechanism is shown to have been defective, i.e. to have had ‘discrepancies.’ In v. 54 Kumārila is thus cataloguing the ways in which a cognition can be rendered invalid and saying that two of these ways are indeed reducible to the the identification of discrepancies.[^83] (The third, non-perception, will be a special case.)

[^82]: These were mooted by the opponent at vv. 38–9.

[^83]: Notice it’s not enough for there to *be* discrepancies—they must be turned up somehow. Otherwise those cognitions would not have been valid in the first place, and Kumārila is claiming that they were.

By ‘falsity,’ Kumarila means not the actual falsity or inaccuracy of the initial cognition but rather the case in which some such inaccuracy is turned up, or in which some defect in the mechanism behind the cognition is turned up, so that the initial cognition is altogether overturned. The case of doubt requires not so much an overturning as an unsettling; thus in a stock Indian example you might be unsure whether you’re looking at (or saw) a piece of silver or rather a bit of shell. Kumārila is considering these cases in vv. 57–61:

>   57. Unauthoritativeness (falsity) is got at directly through the “Cognition >   (of its contradictory).” For, so long as the former is not set aside, the >   subsequent cognition (of its contradictory) cannot be produced.

>   58. Though the cognition of the discrepancy of the cause is known to refer >   to a different object (*i.e.*, not the object which is the effect of tlie >   cause), yet we have co-objectivity (of the two cognitions) as being implied >   thereby; and hence we have the preclusion of the former,—as in the case of >   the “milking-pot.”[^84]

[^84]: Kumārila adduces an example from ritual: Jhā *ad. loc.*

>   59. But this rule applies only to those cases in which (with regard to the >   second conception) there is neither cognition of any discrepancy, nor any >   contradictory conception. In those cases, however, in which we have any of >   these two factors, the second conception becoming false, the first comes to >   be true.

>   60. But in that case too, the authoritativeness is due to the conception >   itself, in the absence of any cognition of discrepancies. And in a case >   where there is no such cognition of discrepancies, there is no reasonable >   ground for doubt.

The ‘falsity’ case well illustrates one form of the extrinsic nature of invalidity. It’s in having the *new* cognition that the earlier one is set aside and rendered invalid. (And should the new cognition itself prove faulty, the original cognition is valid again—not because it’s gained new support but because the objections have been lifted—thus the validity of a valid cognition is intrinsic even if it loses and regains that status.[^85] This is not just a psychological point. It may be that, as a psychological matter, it’s impossible to credit both the old idea that Hirut is beautiful and the new idea that she’s plain, but as a psychological matter one could reject the new information rather than the old. But for Kumarila, the new cognition, is, barring some further problem with *it*, itself intrinsically valid, just as the old one had been valid up to this point. The process of discarding the old way of looking at things is, moreover, an inferential process, not merely a causal one, and this is clearest in the case where a cognition is not just straightforwardly at odds with the earlier cognition in terms of its content, but where the new cognition apprehends something problematic about the causal basis of the original cognition, which is the case Kumarila considers here:

[^85]: vv. 59–60.

>   58. Though the cognition of the discrepancy of the cause is known to refer >   to a different object (i.e. not the object which is the effect of the >   cause), yet we have co-objectivity (of the two cognitions) as being implied >   thereby; and hence we have the preclusion of the former,—as in the case of >   the “milking-pot.”[^86]

[^86]: With the reference to the milking-pot Kumārila adduces an example from ritual to illustrate his point: Jhā *ad. loc.*

For this case we could imagine that rather than seeing Hirut and finding her plain, you learn that the *Times* reporter in question has abnormal aesthetic sensibilities. Finally, v. 60 above was explicit that there is a question of rationality here: it would be a *mistake* to give up your view of Hirut’s beauty barring some specific reason for doing so.

When in the case of ‘falsity’ a cognition is set aside, it is, in a sense, not really even apt for validity any more, since it is no longer constitutes one’s view of the world anyway. Likewise with the case of doubt; the view has been suspended in a way that would make it inappropriate to ask, for example, whether the subject is justified in holding it.[^87] The same point would seem to hold doubly for the case of non-perception, the case in which you were simply not in contact with the world at all, as might be the case in dreams or the aforementioned case of ‘fancy,’ or wishful thinking.

[^87]: A doubt carries no commitment in any direction in the first place—this point fits with my earlier discussion where I supposed that validity presupposses *definiteness* as I interpreted that term; cf. [@bhatt1962epistemology].

>   55. In the case of non-perception, however, we do not admit the action of >   such discrepancies. Because for us all non-perception is due to the >   *absence* of cause,—just as you have asserted.

This case important because it illustrates a claim I’ve made a couple of times—and in doing so address the earlier objections about dream cognitions and so on—namely that cognition must have a certain causal origin if it was ever to have validity in the first place. ‘Fancy’ and wishful thinking, for example, are not sources of valid cognition,[^88], but only special cases of non-perception. We remember that v. 48 had said that it was only for its birth that a positive entity required a cause—here there is no (sound) cause in the first place, and no positive entity (ie. no valid cognition). This implicitly offers a response to the dream objection of v. 40.

[^88]: vv. 94–5; cf. v. 128.

The non-perception case also allows us to appreciate more clearly that validity cannot be anything like *truth.* If I daydream the beautiful Hirut into existence, then later forget it was a daydream and actually come to believe that there was a beautiful Ethiopian singer named Hirut, the belief may or may not in fact be *true*; Ethiopia has it’s singers, Hirut is a reasonably common name there, and it is a land of beautiful women; some woman may very well be all of those things. But there is no question or possibility of *validity* here. Validity requires a causal basis (such as testimony or perception) that can (though may not always) mediate some kind of contact between you and the word. If there’s no actual chain between the world and your thoughts about it, you can’t have valid cognitions about it, however accurate your speculations might be. Kumārila applies his conclusions to the case of testimony:

>   64. In (truthful) human (speech) we find two (factors)—*absence of >   discrepancies,* and (*presence of*) *excellence*; and we have already >   explained that authoritativeness cannot be due to *excellence*.

>   65–6. Therefore excellences must be held to help only in the removal of >   discrepancies; and from the absence of these latter (discrepancies), >   proceeds the absence of the two kinds of unauthoritativeness; and thus the >   fact of (authoritativeness) being inherent in Words remains untouched. And >   inasmuch as the word gives rise to a conception, its authoritativeness is >   secured.

When Kumārila says it has already been explained that validity cannot be due to the excellences of testimony, he must mean that a cognition is not valid in virtue of *recognizing* that the source of knowledge, in this case testimony, was free of fault. He exploits this point to respond to the objection that his own view does face a regress, despite earlier protestations:

>   66. “If the absence of discrepancies be held to result from excellences, >   then there is the same *regressus ad infinitum* (that you urged against us.”

>   67. (Not so): because at that time (ie. at the time of the conception of the >   absence of discrepancies), we do not admit of any active functioning of the >   excellences, though they continue to be recognised all the same;—because in >   the conception of the absence of discrepancies they help by their mere >   presence.

As we have seen before, one need not actually have an appreciation of the soundness of the basis of a conception for it to be valid. There is also a slight puzzle here, though, because v. 67 seems to suggest that in fact a valid cognition *must* have a *sound* basis. But that cannot be right, because it would mean that testimonial cognitions are not after all valid just as such, and as we can see even here (from the the last sentence of vv. 65–6) validity *does not* depend on the actual faultlessness of the testimony in question: testimony just as such *is* a source of valid cognitions. I therefore take v. 67 to mean that the *presumed* excellences of the source of a cognition suffice (so far as the source is of an approved variety: testimony, perception, etc.).

This is confirmed by the next verses, as we turn to the case of the Vedas, where Kumārila claims that the very testimonial nature of Vedic-derived cognitions imbues them with validity:

>   70. Hence the mere fact of the Veda not having been composed by an >   authoritative author, ceases to be a discrepancy. …

>   71. It is only human speech that depends for its authority upon another Mean >   of Right Knowlede; and hence in the absence of the latter, the former >   becomes faulty; but the other (ie. Vedic sentences) can never be so (on that >   ground).

We have returned here to the second-order case: testimonial cognitions may be presumed sound just on the basis of being testimonial cognitions, though in the the typical or human case, where testimonial knowledge is parasitic on other sources of knowledge, that presumption would be overruled by the observation that the testifier had no way of coming by his supposed knowledge. In the case of the Vedas, so such difficulty can arrive, and the presumption stands.

Verse 72 returns us to the matter of independence:

>   72. Thus then, the very fact of the incompatibility of the Veda with other >   Means of Right Notion, constitutes its authoritativeness; for if it were not >   so incompatible, it would only be subsidiary (to other such means).

The point here is that Vedic testimony produces cognitions—which are intrinsically valid—which could never be called into question by any other source of knowledge, the Vedas are an authority: they produce cognitions which must be trusted.

This may seem to reopen our question about dreams and fancies. Perhaps you have dreams about the future, and come to have beliefs about the future in that way, and these beliefs cannot be undermined by perception or inference. Does that make dreaming authoritative concerning the future? Kumārila does not think so, but not, I think, for deep reasons of epistemological theory proper; it is just that dreaming and Vedic testimony are different cases. On Kumārila’s view, dreams and fancies just take the matter of perception and mix it up in arbitrary ways; they are not new sources of information. One could, of course, say the same about the Vedas—but Kumārila wouldn’t agree. He thinks that language and meaning are deep and primitive aspects of the cosmos, that the cosmos is eternal, that it’s reasonable to suppose that the Vedas were never written, and that they tap into eternal meanings somehow. Those are matters separate from epistemology, nor does Kumārila suppose himself to have defended any of those claims at this stage.[^89]

[^89]: Verse 70 in its entirety runs thus: “Hence the mere fact of the Veda not having been composed by an authoritative author, ceases to be a discrepancy. Of the syllogistic arguments urged against us, we shall lay down counter-arguments hereafter.”

We pass over vv. 73–81, which continue discussing the independence of Vedas, and arrive at an objection in v. 82:

>   82. (Objection): “But Sense-Perception and the rest are not comprehended as >   that ‘these are authoritative’; nor is it possible to carry on any business >   by means of such perceptions, when they are not comprehended as such.”

The opponent objects that since in forming cognitions we do not yet have any confidence in those cognitions, they cannot be a basis for action or further inference. In responding, Kumārila provides a helpful recapitulation of his view.

>   83. (Reply): Even prior to comprehension, the Means of Right Notion had an >   independent existence of their own and they come to be comprehended >   subsequently (as such), through other cognitions.

A cognition is valid and serves as a basis for action and inference even without any appreciating its existence; when its existence is appreciated, this is in a new cognition.

>   84. Therefore the fact of its being comprehended as such, does not in any >   way help the authoritativeness (of the Means of Right Notion); because the >   idea of the object is got at through the former alone.

The second-order recognition of a cognition as valid is not necessary for the validity of that cognition, nor can it confer validity upon it.

>   85. Even the unauthoritative Means would, by itself, lead to the conception >   of its object; and its function would not cease unless its falsity were >   ascertained by other means.

Even an invalid cognition manifests the world, though it may do so wrongly (it may for example reveal a real shell only as a piece of silver[^90]), but until it is revealed as misleading it is accepted, and forms a basis for further inference. Notice here that a cognition can be invalid but still manifest the world; hence validity cannot be manifestation. We should also see here a connection to action: so far as v. 85 itself goes, we might think that the ‘function’ of a cognitions was restricted to manifestation, and that may indeed be the primary meaning, but in the context of the objection of the objection at v. 82, Kumārila evidently means that, in virtue of the exercising its function, a cognition (even an invalid one) functions as a basis for action.

[^90]: Jhā *ad loc.*

Finally we end with a reiteration of the intrinsicality of validity and the extrinsicality of invalidity:

>   86. The falsity of an object is not, like its truthfulness, perceived by its >   very first conception. For the recognition of unauthoritativeness, the only >   cause is one’s consciousness of the falsity of its subject itself, or of he >   faultiness of the cause thereof.

>   87. Thereby alone is falsity (of a conception) established; and by no other >   means. And the truthfulness (or authoritativeness of a conception) is proved >   to *belong to the state of its birth* (*i.e.*, is natural or inherent in >   it).

>   88. Therefore even in cases where falsity is proved by other means, these >   two (causes of falsity) should be noted, and not only certain points of >   similarity (with another false idea).

Kumārila’s Conception of Knowledge ==================================

Taber compares the intrinsic validity thesis with Descartes’ idea that some ideas are “clear and distinct,” so that their truth is self-evident; and again he compares Kumārila’s thesis to the Stoic notion of [phantasia kataleptike], or “kataleptic impressions,” impressions or appearances which contain some mark guaranteeing their truth.[^91] Taber points out that unlike kataleptic impressions or clear and distinct ideas, intrinsically valid cognitions are not uncommon; on Taber’s interpretation all cognitions are at least initially intrinsically valid. The more important disanalogy, which Taber must himself insist on, but nevertheless seems really to *spoil* the analogy, is that intrinsically valid cognitions needn’t be true, whereas the whole point of the Stoic and Cartesian notions is to isolate a *special class* of impressions or ideas which have a special warrant. J. N. Mohanty is right in saying that the whole spirit of Kumārila’s view is the rejection of the notion of self-evidence; as he puts it,

[^91]: p. 217.

>   it is precisely the contention of the *svatahprāmānya* theory…that *there is >   no criterion of truth, though there are criteria of error.*[^92]

[^92]: [@mohanty1989gangesa], his emphasis.

Taber’s comparison with Reid’s commmon-sense philosophy is probably more apt;[^93] and I think that Philo would be a better Hellenistic analogue of Kumārila than the Stoics. According to what seems to be the dominant reconstruction, Philo, who led the Academy for some time, was first of all a radical skeptic in the manner of Clitomachus, later adopted the mitigated skepticism of Metrodorus, and finally in his (unfortunately not extant) ‘Roman Books’ advocated a sort of fallibilism.[^94] The Academics seem to have generally accepted (if only for the purposes of launching counter-arguments) the Stoic understanding of knowledge, which required the afore-mentioned *phantasia kataleptike*: knowledge requires an accurate impression appropriately caused by what it represents, and which contains some mark which shows that it meets those two conditions. The Academics argued that there were no such impressions, since any true impression could be mimicked by a false one. The skeptics view, like the Stoics, thought that one ought not to assent to what one does not know; thus a radical skeptic would ideally refuse ever to assent to anything. A mitigated skepticism, on the other hand, would allow the reasonableness of forming some beliefs even without allowing the existence of a criterion of truth; some appearances might at least constitute good, if never conclusive, evidence. But Philo ultimately redefined the notion of a kataleptic impression, accepting the requirements of truth and of a suitable causal basis, but removing the requirement that such an impression guarantee its own truth, which he still considered to be an impossible standard to meet. This meant that it would not only be reasonable to form beliefs but that kataleptic impressions *were* after all possible, and one might rationally accept these without qualificaton. But since the requirement for a criterion of truth had been abandoned, one might very well be mistaken about whether one actually possessed a kataleptc impression.

[^93]: pp. 217–18.

[^94]: [@frede-sceptic], [@barnes1989antiochus], [@striker1997academics], [@brittain2001philo]; see [@sep-philo-larissa] for a survey.

Philo’s innovation provoked a good deal of hostility. He had, in effect, given up the idea that knowledge must be certain, something assumed by dogmatists and skeptics alike. Kumārila’s validity does not require truth, but, like Philo, he decided that the reigning epistemic standard was impossible for any cognition to achieve, and thus redefined it so that it could be claimed as a matter of course. As with Philo, this was met by complaints from outside his own school and also with disbelief from inside it. Thus a latter commentator, Umbeka, found a way interpret Kumārila as making validity entail truth after all. In India, as in the Hellenistic world, knowledge was supposed to be certain. Kumārila’s innovation, like Philo’s, lies precisely in giving up that requirement as in any case impossible.

In both cases, the reinterpretation of knowledge is at least in part a response to the demands of practical activity. A major criticism of the radically skeptical position was that it made action and virtue impossible, since both require belief. Efforts were made to reconcile action with the skeptics’ traditional refusal to assent, but the mitigated skeptical position amounted to a way of allowing for assent without allowing for knowledge or certainty. Since the mitigated position winds up buying into dogmatic conceptions of knowledge in a way that radical skeptics could claim to avoid, the Philonian position can be understood as an attempt to just find a new understanding of knowledge that was a better fit with the practical considerations driving the mitigated skeptics’ concessions in the first place.

Likewise Kumārila reinvents the notion of knowledge to allow for the demands of practice. Moral or *dharmic* knowledge will be impossible without the authority of Vedic texts—the Buddhists, for example, are wrong to suppose that perception will suffice. But Vedic testimony cannot meet the standards imposed by the epistemological theories of other schools, which would require either a kind of self-evidence of which no cognition is capable, or verification which is in this case impossible. How then would one pursue *dharma*? Human beings must act, and they must have moral guidance. It cannot be unreasonable to act as best you can, relying in the best resources available, even if the soundness of these resources cannot be established. That is part of what it is to be reasonable, and the standards of theoretical reason should not say otherwise.
