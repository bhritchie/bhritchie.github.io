I was once a PhD candidate in philosophy at Harvard, and I was fairly pleased with some of the work I did there. Hopefully I’ll get around to properly publishing a bit of it, but here are some of the highlights in the meantime. More to come.

Forgive formatting errors. I converted these papers from LaTeX to Markdown automatically, and I’m still cleaning them up.

- [Socrates’ Conception of Knowledge](/2014/11/15/socrates-conception-of-knowledge/)

> <span class="abstract-label">Abstract</span>. I articulate the Socratic understanding of *techne*---expertise---and argue that, for Socrates, *techne* is knowledge. This sheds light on various other aspects of Socrates’ philosophy.

- [Svataḥ Prāmāṇya in Kumārila Bhaṭṭa](/2014/11/19/svatah-pramanya-in-kumarila-bhatta/)

> <span class="abstract-label">Abstract</span>. [Kumārila Bhaṭṭa](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kumaarila/), an influential Indian philosopher of the 8th century, argues that beliefs are *svataḥ prāmāṇya* (generally glossed as &lsquo;intrinsically valid’). This has often been understood to mean, both clasically and by contemporary writers, to amount to the unpromising view that all beliefs are true, or alternatively that all beliefs are justified. I defend a more sympathetic interpretation according to which Kum\=arila claims that beliefs are presumptively justified, the grounds for this claim being that other understandings of epistemic justification entail vicious justificatory regress.
