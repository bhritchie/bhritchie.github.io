  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abstract-label&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/span&gt;. In this paper I offer a novel defence against the problem of evil based on an understanding of goodness derived from Peter Geach. On this understanding, all goodness (and badness) depends on a ‘functional context.’ We can interpret evil in terms of human dysfunction. One form of dysfunction derives from incompletion. If evil is a matter of our incomplete state, then we canot infer any fault in our Creator, because we do not know what we may yet become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-from-value-theory-to-the-problem-of-evil&quot;&gt;I. From Value Theory to the Problem of Evil&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter Geach argued that ‘good’ is a “logically attributive adjective,” by which he meant that anything good is good &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; something: a thing cannot be &lt;em&gt;simply&lt;/em&gt; good.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Geach’s idea has needed refinement.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; My own way of articulating the idea is that goodness occurs in &lt;em&gt;functional contexts:&lt;/em&gt; evaluative language operates against a conception of how things are supposed to be work or what they are for. I will try to explain what I mean by this shortly. But my principal interest here is in how this idea sheds light on the problem of evil. Taking this approach to value, we might interpret evil in terms of human dysfunction. Then we should observe that there is a form of dysfunction which stems from incompletion. Such incompletion, I will argue, does no discredit to a designer. So if evil is a matter of incompletion—if we ourselves are imperfect &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; incomplete—then we cannot with justice suppose our Designer to lack power or any interest in us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ii-function-and-goodness&quot;&gt;II. Function and Goodness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In central cases, what we say of something in saying that it is good depends on what we may refer to as standards internal to it. Take an artifact such as a knife. A knife is made to cut. A good knife (a knife that is good &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; a knife) is therefore one well suited to cutting. A knife can be merely instrumentally good as well—a kitchen knife could do fine duty as a weapon. Human purposes or desires are not required for the existence of internal standards. When we talk about the good of plants and animals we draw on a conception of the proper functioning of these organisms or their parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also derivative forms of goodness. There is such a thing as good complexion, for example, and complexions may or may not themselves be functional, but good complexion, in the basic case, betrays good health, and that brings us to a functional context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where no functional context exists (or where we see no functional context), it is unintelligible to speak of goodness. I would not know what to make of the question whether the number three is good; neither could I say whether Saturn is good, unless it were specified that we were after something to colonize, or mine, or investigate scientifically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some cases are difficult, particularly as we turn to moral philosophy. What makes something a good thing to do, morally speaking? Could there be standards internal to action? Or is the goodness of a person conceptually prior to the goodness of action? Or should what is good &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; people be of primary interest? It is no part of my view that answers to such questions must always be obvious, though if my view is assumed, then I believe we ought to approach moral theory along Aristotelian lines—I would hold, in particular, that a conception of what it is to be a good person is parasitic on a conception of what a person &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;is for&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start with a suggestion from Michael Thompson’s “The Representation of Life.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This is that the possibility of describing a given organism as having arms rather than, say, deformed wings depends on a conception of the form of life of which that organism partakes. Nothing else could settle what that stuff at its sides are. Nothing could settle the question, for example, in the case of a creature which, resembling a man, is only a freak amalgamation of unlikely quantum happenings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, our conception of a form of life finds canonical expression in irreducible, non-statistical generalizations which Thompson calls “Aristotelian categoricals.” An example is “cats have four legs.” This is true although not all cats have four legs, and could be true even if by a series of traumatic events most cats had some other number of legs. For Thompson, these generalities constitute the primitive form of our understanding of life. And they further constitute the standards of evaluation for organisms: if cats have four legs and this cat has only three, then it is defective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will not quite do—Thompson’s account makes no room, for example, for the possibility that in failing to satisfy some generality, an individual might be not defective but exceptional. Neither will attention to the grammatical form of the Aristotelian categorical distinguish characterizations of human life as such from characterizations of a given form of social life. Philippa Foot offers “humans establish rules of conduct and recognize rights” as an Aristotelian categorical, but why shouldn’t the following serve just as well: “when rations are meagre, the Karamojong give the available food to their girls, who can be traded for cattle [thereby leaving the boys to starve]”?&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I think we should agree that what constitutes an organism’s thriving depends on what it &lt;em&gt;is,&lt;/em&gt; but we should locate the relevant descriptions within an historical context; we should draw them from a conception of how an organism is &lt;em&gt;designed&lt;/em&gt; to operate. We could try to understand this in evolutionary terms, but in the present context we may appeal to a conception of what it is that God made us for—of how he intended for us to live. What it is to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; a human, then, is a question about what a human is &lt;em&gt;for,&lt;/em&gt; and that determines what it is to succeed as a human. A good life, in turn, is a life in accord with the virtues which allow for such success, and supplied with the materials for their exercise.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been a very brief summary of the value theory I favour, without any serious attempt at argument.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Its distance from familiar metaethical theories will be plain; it holds, for example, that the infamous open-question argument merely trades on a confusion about what sort of property goodness is. I do hope the approach might be reasonably amenable to Christians in particular. Perhaps there is no great consensus on metaethical matters among Christian philosophers, but many of them have found it natural to work within an Aristotelian framework, and these ideas should not seem strange to Christians: that humans are artifacts; that what we are is therefore importantly a matter of our history, which has been partially revealed to us; that we cannot live well apart from God’s plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-nature-of-evil&quot;&gt;The Nature of Evil&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rocks make bad cushions, my father takes a perverse delight in awful puns, Budweiser is a bad beer, un-oiled motorcycles run poorly. The world is full of these and other sorts of badness, but they are not problems &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; the world, and no one could think to wonder how God could allow them. But the presence of &lt;em&gt;evil&lt;/em&gt; might be a problem with the world that we could lay at God’s feet. How is evil to be understood in terms of the present theory, and will evil so understood pose a challenge to belief in a benevolent and almighty God?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose that evil is badness in certain spheres. In particular, what is bad for humans, or what manifests harm already done to humans, is evil. Natural evils, then, are natural events that damage or destroy lives. Evil thoughts are the thoughts of a damaged person. Evil actions are actions doing harm or reflecting evil thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the understanding of the human good which I elucidated in the previous section, what I have just said is that evils are things that prevent us from living out our proper aim, or that reflect our so failing to live it out. Natural evils obstruct our proper realization. Evil thoughts are the thoughts of imperfect creatures, insofar as they are imperfect or corrupt. Evil actions reflect such thoughts, or make perfection harder or impossible for ourselves or others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that is reasonable, then I suggest that the question “why is there evil” is equivalent to the question “why aren’t we perfect?”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;imperfection-and-incompletion&quot;&gt;Imperfection and Incompletion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than one interesting answer might be offered in response to the question just posed. The one I want to suggest is the following: we aren’t perfect because we aren’t finished yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do I mean by saying that we are not finished? Well, John tells us that what exactly we shall be has not yet been revealed.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:9&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:9&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; If John doesn’t know what a completed human looks like then I certainly don’t. But it seems we’re not it (though we’ve been given instruction for getting there). Paul also tells us as much: he compares us to buildings, laid on the foundation of Jesus Christ, and expresses confidence that the One who began that work will bring it to completion; even as our outer nature wastes away we do not lose heart, because we know our inner nature is being renewed—that we are transformed into the Lord’s image by stages.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:10&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:10&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The Christian view, then, is that we are are extraordinary artifacts, capable of contributing to (or even thwarting) our own formation—and this formation is not yet complete. Now the idea I want to exploit is that it shows no lack of skill or care in a designer that his creation is not finished all at once; no incompetence on the part of the sculptor is revealed by the fact that he must chip away at a stone before it is a polished statue. God neither needs nor lacks time, but the &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; involved in the creative process is not the point: the thing to see is that there are two different ways in which an artifact can be imperfect, holding the imperfection constant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose I have a tree fort out back. It is not in completely satisfactory shape, because when it rains water runs through the slats in the roof. The roof requires a tarpaulin. Now it might be that the fort once had such a tarpaulin and now lacks it, because I am not very good at affixing tarpaulins and the wind took it, or because I’ve been neglecting the fort altogether for some time. However, it might be that everything is on schedule—I’m just not finished yet. It’s right there on the calendar. Day five (today): roof slats. Day six: tarpaulin. Day seven: relax in new tree fort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There might be any number of reasons I planned to do things over six days—I’m busy with other things, or anyways I can only work so fast. I might just be savouring the creative process. What there cannot be here is any presumption of incompetence or neglect. No one can fairly ask of me, “what went wrong?” So long as there are no missteps in the process of construction, an artifact at a given stage just &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; as it’s supposed to be—that is, it is as it’s supposed to be for now. So some imperfection indicates incompetence or negligence, in which case imperfection constitutes shoddiness or decay. And then there is imperfection which indicates no such thing. And it will not always be possible to tell which sort we are looking at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course a craftsman might fail to complete a project in the first place out of incompetence or lack of interest. Likewise, defect could be introduced quite willfully post-completion, and then need not represent any kind of authorial &lt;em&gt;failing.&lt;/em&gt; So, in one sense, the distinction is ahistorical, and is just a distinction between the defects which find their origin in sloth, incompetence, neglect, and decay, and the lackings which reflect deliberate policy. It seems to me also important however whether or not the artifact in question has ever been complete, so that the concern is also an historical one. If I keep pulling my fort apart and reworking it, that looks like tinkering: like I either don’t know how to finish my project off or don’t much care how it winds up. Similarly, lack of care will look like the right explanation if I allow the once-finished fort to disintegrate. This is going to be trouble in the case of human imperfection. If we were once perfect and are so no longer, how is this? If the destructive agency was our own, why should we, having been perfect, have engaged in such self-destruction?&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:11&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:11&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; If the destructive agent is God, he begins to look somewhat capricious. That, of course, is why I have proposed that we are imperfect because incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is my whole solution. Let me run through it once more. We begin with a sense that something is wrong with the world. But if things are according to plan, then nothing is wrong with the world. Now it could be that nothing is &lt;em&gt;wrong,&lt;/em&gt; but that the plan still reveals something unflattering about God. If the so-called plan is just to put things together and pull them apart again then we are dealing only with a divine tinkerer. If the plan was just to set everything going and then let it wind down, we have only the deists’ god. But that is not how things in fact are: God has manifested concern for us and has shown no inconstancy of purpose.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:12&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:12&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There might seem to be a third worry, though. My tree fort could come out just as intended, and yet be a pretty cruddy tree fort. I do not set the standards here: for all that my fort matches my blueprints, I will have made a poor one if it is carried away by the slightest breeze. So couldn’t we allow that we are proceeding according to God’s plans, and still wonder at the wisdom of those plans? Perhaps. Keeping in mind the present theory of value, there is the difficulty of knowing what criteria we should be appealing to. We may not simply help ourselves to such. I suppose that a conception of the goodness of a world must draw principally on a conception of certain kinds of evil or damage &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; that world, and this has already been our topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet there must be &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; criteria for evaluating a world as a whole. God made the world and saw that it was good, and I at least want to agree with this. So what does it mean? Mainly, I think, that our world shows exquisite workmanship.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:13&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:13&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But perhaps not only that the world displays great craft but that it is in some further sense &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt;—worth the Artisan’s time. I confess I have no account of aesthetic value. But I wonder if anyone has a pretty definite feeling that an omnipotent being should have made something &lt;em&gt;nicer&lt;/em&gt; than our world? And even if our complaint were that &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; are shoddily done, this will be an unfair charge if my hypothesis is correct: I know of no serious complaint about what we &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still it will be natural to worry that the problem of evil has been pushed back. Why does God create this way? Why not make humans whole and complete from the start, and skip over the period of imperfection and suffering? Do I think that the good of self-creation somehow outweighs the evil that is suffering? That would after all be a familiar sort of approach to the problem. But I am not saying that. “Why would God create this way?” may be an interesting question, but it calls for no &lt;em&gt;excuse,&lt;/em&gt; because the imperfections in question here are only of the work-in-progress type. Compare children. God could have created—perhaps has elsewhere created—intelligent creatures which reproduce by division. Such creatures would avoid some of our trials and errors. And yet all is in order when a human being is a child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically the same response can be made to another worry: why would God allow us to come to completion along paths like the prodigal son’s, or indeed to refuse or fail to complete ourselves at all? Couldn’t he orchestrate matters such that we complete ourselves without the errors and rebellion and regression? Must I here appeal to free will, so falling back on another standard response to the problem of evil? To be sure, if we are not free, then perhaps the fact that some of us are never completed would have to be attributed to God: it would be He who had not finished the work. But again I need not claim, what would in any case be doubtful, that granting us freedom was a &lt;em&gt;risk worth taking&lt;/em&gt; or that the evils attendant thereupon are &lt;em&gt;costs worth bearing,&lt;/em&gt; because I do not believe that there is any matter of weighing up goods here. Hirut, being a child, makes a child’s errors: that is not a price she pays for childhood but a fact of childhood.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:14&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:14&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all this may seem an overly abstract approach to the problem of evil: the problem of evil is a problem about—among other things—&lt;em&gt;suffering.&lt;/em&gt; Suffering is no laughing matter, and it is likewise a serious thing that we are imperfect and that we refuse to be obedient to God’s will for us. But, to make a rather blunt appeal to my value theory here, nothing is &lt;em&gt;just plain&lt;/em&gt; good or bad. In particular, pain is not just plain bad. Pain, like pleasure, plays an important biological role, and its sheer visceral awfulness is required by that role—the &lt;em&gt;inability&lt;/em&gt; to feel pain is after all a serious medical problem.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:15&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:15&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Suffering is appropriate to damaged and imperfect creatures, and to the extent that we are damaged and suffer thereby, things are as they should be. It is where pain does not respond properly to damage that it is bad, just as pleasure is bad when it is taken in what is perverse. The special connection of pain to badness is not that it is somehow a primitive evil, but that, in the typical case, it &lt;em&gt;registers&lt;/em&gt; evils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion-some-implications&quot;&gt;Conclusion: Some Implications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some final observations. The first regards natural evils, about which I may seem to have said nothing. On the Christian view, immortality goes with perfection. There must then be ways for imperfect man to die. That means natural evils. Not necessarily, maybe. Perhaps God could arrange the world so that, like Tolkien’s elves, we could only die unnatural deaths at each other’s hands. But then we might agree with Tolkien that natural death is a generous gift for a stunted creature.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:16&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:16&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second observation is that my proposal fits happily with our evolutionary origins. This greatly pleases me, since evolution has been thought, also by my earlier self, to make the problem of evil &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; difficult. It fits rather less well with the view that there was any such historical event as the fall. That, I believe, is satisfactory—true both to our scientific understanding of the world and to fair biblical interpretation. I believe the Genesis account is true, though not that it is true &lt;em&gt;history.&lt;/em&gt; It tells us that God created us and everything around us, that God cares about us and requires our obedience, and that things are in their imperfect state because of our failure to be obedient. To all of this my view is amenable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I want to go back to Geach, who could be a tough-minded man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Resurrection is in any case a merely gratuitous gift of God. A race of rational creatures to whom this gratuitous gift had not been given might well be mortal and perish at death; God would not thereby default on any implied promise to them or in any way be acting unjustly.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:17&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:17&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul says something similar in a difficult passage which however bothers me less than it once did:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Scripture says to Pharaoh, “For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I might show my power in you, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.” So then he has mercy on whomever he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills. You will say to me then, “Why does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?” But who are you, O man, to answer back to God? Will what is molded say to its molder, “Why have you made me like this?” Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of the same lump one vessel for honored use and another for dishonorable use?&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:18&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:18&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If God had made us to be no more than we now are, we should have no cause for complaint. Paul and Geach are reminding us that it is a mistake about value to suppose we ought to live, or could live better by living, some life other than the one God has for us, or to think that God could err in making us. So maybe we should turn our problem on its head. If we feel ourselves to have grounds for complaint, this suggests we think that we were made to live in some other way than we do. On what grounds should we think such a thing? &lt;em&gt;My&lt;/em&gt; grounds are that God promised it. So perhaps Christians have the resources not only to turn the complaint but to make it intelligible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;

    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Peter Geach, “Good and Evil,” &lt;em&gt;Analysis&lt;/em&gt; 17 (1956) &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;See, for example, J. J. Thomson, “On Some Ways in Which a Thing Can Be Good.” &lt;em&gt;Social Philosophy and Policy&lt;/em&gt; 9 (1992). &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;But that is not inevitable. The Geachean view about value might also be amenable to the Kantian view that action has, just as such, aims and therefore standards internal to it. Action aspires to be action that satisfies those aims; good action is therefore action that achieves them. See, for example, Christine Korsgaard, “Self-Constitution in the Ethics of Plato and Kant,” &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Ethics,&lt;/em&gt; vol. 3 no. 1 (March 1999). &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Natural Goodness,&lt;/em&gt; p. 51; the quote about the Karamojong is borrowed from David Lamb’s &lt;em&gt;The Africans,&lt;/em&gt; Vintage Books (1987), p. 81. It is inessential to the example that the second description mentions only the Karamojong—it is an historical accident that they and not others behave this way; by a similar accident they might have been the only humans to respect rights. And yet respecting rights, and not starving boys, might be proper to human life. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:5&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:6&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This follows Aristotle. A good life is not merely &lt;em&gt;success,&lt;/em&gt; since certain functions might be as easily carried out in a coma, or even in death, as in action, and our concern is a practical one. Attention to the conceptual structure here also provides resources for responding to certain objections such as “what if we were designed to suffer?” But this is complicated and I will pursue the matter no further here. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:6&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:7&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I have passed over, or at least not addressed at all directly, many important questions like “why think we have a function?” “why should we care whether we have a function?” and “what if it turned out we had some really weird function?” (But see n. 6.) I flag these questions only to avoid pretending that I’ve answered them. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:7&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;I shall have nothing to say specifically about animals in this paper. What I say about pain below is relevant, though, and will probably reveal the fact that I do not think the animal case particularly interesting. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:8&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:11&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There are, certainly, interesting stories about how this might have happened: my own favorite can be found in the first chapter of Tolkien’s &lt;em&gt;Silmarillion.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:11&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:12&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is just an appeal to Christian dogma, of course. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:12&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:13&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A sunset can be beautiful but not good; a painting of a sunset can be both. The difference is the technical aspect that is involved in painting. To see the craft our world displays, compare it to the one described by C. S. Lewis in “The Shoddy Lands.” &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:13&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:14&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In particular my view is not like that of John Hick or Irenaeus, though we share the idea that evils exist because humans are not yet what they are meant to be. For Hick, soul-making is &lt;em&gt;worth&lt;/em&gt; the suffering, and there is much abstract talk of “realizing value.” Part of Irenaeus’ line of thought is similar; he suggests what Tolkien has put so well, that without the present darkness “we should not know, or so much love, what we do love.” I make no appeal to a balance of good over evil, or to any good that evil brings. Irenaeus also defends the gradual creation of man by appeal to the claim that humans are “too new” to be perfect. But I do not think the creative process that has been employed needs to be defended by appeal to creative constraints. It is the Creator’s to do as He will. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:14&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:15&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;CNN once reported on a girl with a congenital incapacity to feel pain: “Some people would say that’s a good thing. But no, it’s not,” says Tara Blocker, Ashlyn’s mother. “Pain’s there for a reason. It lets your body know something’s wrong and it needs to be fixed. I’d give anything for her to feel pain.” I found this remarkable statement on September 16th, 2006, at http://www.general-anaesthesia.com/congenital-insensitivity/nopain.html. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:15&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:16&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Natural evils result in both more and less than death, of course. It is indeed a feature of our present life that we are part of a natural world which contains, besides death, destruction and pain and decay. But then this is just a more general feature of what it is for a human to be incomplete. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:16&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abstract-label&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kumaarila/&quot;&gt;Kumārila Bhaṭṭa&lt;/a&gt;, an influential Indian philosopher of the 8th century, argues that beliefs are &lt;em&gt;svataḥ prāmāṇya&lt;/em&gt; (generally glossed as ‘intrinsically valid’). This has often been understood to mean, both clasically and by contemporary writers, to amount to the unpromising view that all beliefs are true, or alternatively that all beliefs are justified. I defend a more sympathetic interpretation according to which Kum=arila claims that beliefs are presumptively justified, the grounds for this claim being that other understandings of epistemic justification entail vicious justificatory regress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction-the-mmms-inquiry-into-dharma&quot;&gt;Introduction: The Mīmāmsā Inquiry into Dharma&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pūrva Mīmāmsā was first of all a school of exegesis. The great bulk of their founding text—the &lt;em&gt;Mīmāmsā Sūtra&lt;/em&gt;, set down in the 1st or 2nd century AD and credited to one Jaiminī—treats interpretative difficulties in the Vedas, discusses their study, and details rules for settling procedural questions regarding sacrificial ritual. But by the first century, the heyday of ritual was already long past, and there was much skepticism as to whether Mīmāmsā’s constitutive aim—according to &lt;em&gt;MS&lt;/em&gt; I.i.1 the inquiry into &lt;em&gt;dharma&lt;/em&gt;—was best pursued in the Mīmāmsā fashion. There were rival religious traditions: Buddhists and Jains, as well as the plainly nihilistic Cārvākas. And there were rival schools of Vedic exegesis, and many Hindus who, though acknowledging the authority of the Vedas, attributed them to gods—unlike the atheistic Mīmāmsākas, who claimed that the scriptures had simply always existed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it would have seemed appropriate to establish some philosophical foundation for the school. And indeed several epistemological theses are set out in the first chapter of the &lt;em&gt;Mīmāmsā Sūtra&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MS&lt;/em&gt; I.i.4. Perception is knowledge which one has by the senses coming in contact with the soul. It is not the cause of duty [&lt;em&gt;dharma&lt;/em&gt;] by reason of acquiring knowledge of the thing existing.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indian texts are characteristically cryptic. Pithily rendered verses are meant to be committed to memory and elucidated orally by teachers, or studied with the aid of commentaries. And the &lt;em&gt;Mīmāmsā Sūtra&lt;/em&gt; is difficult even by these standards. The verse is obviously invoking some psychological theory—though written around the 1st century, the &lt;em&gt;MS&lt;/em&gt; codifies ideas of much great antiquity.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But we must be satisfied—as Mīmāmsākas of later generations themselves had to be—with the text itself and the only slightly less difficult 5th-century commentary of Śābara.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless the import of the verse is reasonably clear (and this will follow Śābara). For Mīmāmsākas, &lt;em&gt;dharma&lt;/em&gt; concerns a causal system relating actions and future outcomes, so that to perceive &lt;em&gt;dharma&lt;/em&gt; would be to perceive the future. And this verse points out that sense perception makes contact only with what exists in the present. So one cannot learn about &lt;em&gt;dharma&lt;/em&gt; through perception (as the Buddha was purported to have done).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, happily, &lt;em&gt;dharma&lt;/em&gt; is attested to by the Vedas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MS&lt;/em&gt; I.i.5. Certainly there is eternal connection between the word and its meaning; its knowledge is injunction; it is never erroneous in matters invisible; it is authoritative in the opinion of Bādarāyana&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; by reason of its not depending on others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is yet more puzzling than the previous verse, and Śābara offers little more than a paraphrase.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; We seem to be presented with the claim that testimony (i.e. Vedic testimony) is infallible with regard to “matters invisible” (specifically &lt;em&gt;dharma&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The reason for this is, apparently, that Vedic testimony about &lt;em&gt;dharma&lt;/em&gt; does not depend upon “others”: it does not ultimately rely on any of the other legitimate sources of knowledge catalogued by Śābara.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In other words, testimony, which in the ordinary case—and Mīmāmsā joins every other Indian school on this point—can only convey knowledge which was originally acquired in some other way, is, in the special case of &lt;em&gt;dharmic&lt;/em&gt; knowledge, an infallible authority, precisely &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; no other means of acquiring knowledge will do the job. And thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MS&lt;/em&gt; I.i.2. Duty is a purpose having injunction for its sole authority.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we don’t have much idea how these ideas might have been fleshed out in the earlier centuries of the Mīmāmsā school. We ought also to allow for the distance between ourselves and these medieval atheistic scriptural exegetes who take the authorless but eternal and transcendent texts of the Hindu Vedas as the only possible authority for their ritualistic morality. (Though atheists do still walk among us.) We note in particular an astonishingly ‘atemporal’ Indian attitude towards literature in general. Thus&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;we can read thousands of pages of Sanskrit on any imaginable subject and not encounter a single passing reference to a historical person, place, or event—or at least to any that, historically speaking, matters.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea that language has a natural or eternal status seems indeed to have been anticipated in earlier grammatical texts.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:9&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:9&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The &lt;em&gt;Mīmāmsā Sūtra&lt;/em&gt;’s bold epistemology of &lt;em&gt;dharma&lt;/em&gt; is somewhat more intelligible given such facts and the attendant conceptions of the cosmos and our place therein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidently this doesn’t vindicate Mīmāmsā epistemology. Nor were the philosophers of other Indian schools much impressed. There can still be little wonder, then, if even one of the most serious and sympathetic recent scholars of Indian philosophy has found in this aspect of Mīmāmsā “a kind of fundamentalism.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:10&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:10&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter Kumārila Bhatta, a 7th century Mīmāmsāka. His &lt;em&gt;Ślokavārtika&lt;/em&gt;, comprising well over three thousand verses, corresponds to just the first thirty-two verses of the &lt;em&gt;Mīmāmsā Sūtra&lt;/em&gt;—i.e. those verses which had set out the philosophical basis of Mīmāmsā. In this paper we are primarily concerned with the second chapter of the &lt;em&gt;Ślokavārtika&lt;/em&gt;—the &lt;em&gt;Codanāsūtra&lt;/em&gt;, or chapter on injunction—which is framed as a commentary on &lt;em&gt;MS&lt;/em&gt; I.i.2.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:11&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:11&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Kumārila defends the authority of the Vedas on matters of &lt;em&gt;dharma&lt;/em&gt; by way of a quite general epistemological thesis, the ‘&lt;em&gt;svatah prāmānya&lt;/em&gt;,’ or ‘intrinsic validity’ thesis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CS&lt;/em&gt; 47–8. The validity of all valid cognitions is to be understood as intrinsic, since a potency not existing intrinsically cannot be brought about by something else.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:12&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:12&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kumārila is claiming that “cognition” (‘&lt;em&gt;jñāna&lt;/em&gt;’ approximates to ‘occurrent judgment’) is (in some way) epistemically legitimate by default, or immediately. This will ultimately support the authority of the Vedas, since the ideas conveyed by Vedic testimony will also have immediate legitimacy.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:13&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:13&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; And there is no danger that anything will undermine this legitimacy, since in principle no other mode of knowledge acquisition (no other &lt;em&gt;pramāna&lt;/em&gt;, in the Sanskrit terminology) provides knowledge of &lt;em&gt;dharma&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:14&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:14&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given its role in Kumārila’s defense of Vedic authority, the doctrine of &lt;em&gt;svatah prāmāya&lt;/em&gt; has understandably incurred suspicion. But, as John Taber has pointed out, the thesis doesn’t in its own right entail the authoritativeness of the Veda.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:15&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:15&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; That requires accepting the Vedas’ authorlessness, which demands a good deal of theorizing about language and the ontology of reference, the nature of the other &lt;em&gt;pramānas&lt;/em&gt;, and so on; this is also Kumārila’s own understanding of the dialectical situation. So one could accept the Mīmāmsā school’s most general epistemological theses while rejecting Vedic authority. And I believe Taber is also right in arguing that, whatever its provenance, the &lt;em&gt;svatah prāmānya&lt;/em&gt; thesis has merit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe, though, that a satisfactory interpretation of Kumārila’s thesis has yet to be offered. In the next section, §[interpreting], I’ll explain why some prominent interpretations are inadequate, and identify some constraints for an adequate interpretation. In S[validity] I’ll develop my own interpretation, and in §[textualinterpretation] I do the exegetical work. Now as Taber says, the &lt;em&gt;svatah prāmānya&lt;/em&gt; thesis &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be considered independently of the matter of moral knowledge. II’ll do just that in §§[validity]–[textualinterpretation]. But to appreciate the theory’s merits and motives, it is necessary to discuss Kumārila’s epistemological motives more broadly, which I’ll do in §[conception]. In particular, we can understand Kumārila as attempting to reconcile a general epistemological theory with a moral epistemology, and as espousing a conception of knowledge that answers to practical as well as theoretical considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interpretative-approaches-and-contraints&quot;&gt;Interpretative Approaches and Contraints&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us return to Kumārila’s thesis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CS&lt;/em&gt; 47–8. The validity of all valid cognitions is to be understood as intrinsic, since a potency not existing intrinsically cannot be brought about by something else. And [in general] things depend on [other] causes in arising, but once they exist they exercise their functions by themselves.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:16&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:16&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tells us less than we might suppose. The commentarial nature of the Indian philosophical tradition means that conspicuous novelty is avoided. As such, all of the members of a given school will defend nominally the same answer to what is nominally a single question of inter-school interest. In fact different schools, and different writers within a school, may be answering different questions.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:17&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:17&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Likewise nominally identical theses may not at all mean the same thing to different writers. The &lt;em&gt;svatah prāmānya&lt;/em&gt; thesis is a case in point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every school had a position on whether &lt;em&gt;prāmānya&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;em&gt;svatah&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;paratah&lt;/em&gt; to cognition. In English this is often glossed as a question about whether the ‘truth’ or ‘validity’ (&lt;em&gt;prāmānya&lt;/em&gt;) of a cognition is intrinsic (&lt;em&gt;svatah&lt;/em&gt;) or rather extrinsic (&lt;em&gt;paratah&lt;/em&gt;) to that cognition. A scholar will sometimes begin a survey by saying that the Nyāya school holds that truth is extrinsic to cognitions—where the Nyāya view is roughly that there is never a feature of a cognition which establishes that cognition’s accuracy—and then go on to explain how the Buddhists think that both truth &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; falsity are extrinsic to cognitions, even though that would be an absurdity on the Nyāya understanding of ‘truth.’ Buddhists can say that &lt;em&gt;prāmānya&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;aprāmānya&lt;/em&gt; (‘invalidity’ or ‘falsity’) are both &lt;em&gt;paratah&lt;/em&gt; because they have a quite different understanding of &lt;em&gt;prāmānya&lt;/em&gt; in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buddhists and Naiyāyikas are different enough that no-one is much confused about this, but Mīmāmsā is closer to Nyāya and less understood, and confusion about the meanings of theses is a real danger. That there is in fact little value in saying merely that the Mīmāmsā believe that &lt;em&gt;prāmānya&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;svatah&lt;/em&gt; is brought out by the observation that there were plainly different understandings of the &lt;em&gt;svatah prāmāya&lt;/em&gt; thesis in the different branches of Mīmāmsā, and even among Kumārila’s own later followers.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:18&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:18&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Still less can the standard English gloss for the thesis—‘intrinsic validity’—be supposed to convey much about Kumārila’s position. (But this gloss for “the” Mīmāmsā thesis has a long history, and is well-represented in recent discussions of Kumārila, so it would be silly to coin a new phrase now.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:19&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:19&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless Kumārila’s reasoning in vv. 47–8 allows us to eliminate at least some possible readings of ‘validity.’ Validity, which is intrinsic, contrasts with invalidity, which is extrinsic. In the following verses, Kumārila supports these claims with a regress argument: if cognitions were not &lt;em&gt;intrinsically&lt;/em&gt; valid, they would have to derive validity from further cognitions. Those other cognitions must themselves be valid if they are to help, but then, by the hypothesized extrinsic nature of validity, there would have to be yet further cognitions validating &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;, and so on &lt;em&gt;ad infinitem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:20&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:20&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Thus validity must be intrinsic. But while other cognitions cannot make a cognition valid, they &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; make it &lt;em&gt;invalid&lt;/em&gt;, and hence invalidity is extrinsic.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:21&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:21&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Now for Buddhist philosophers, the world is made up of fleeting particulars, and the association or categorization of these particulars which is found in thought is &lt;em&gt;ipso facto&lt;/em&gt; a falsification. The notion of ‘validity’ on the Buddhist view, then, if it is to have utility, cannot be understood in terms of a correspondence between mind and world, but will rather be made out in pragmatic terms: a cognition is valid if the expectations it generates are not later frustrated. To say that validity is &lt;em&gt;svatah&lt;/em&gt;—in some way internal to the cognition itself—rules out at least that view.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:22&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:22&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But that doesn’t narrow the options enormously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;validity-as-truth&quot;&gt;Validity as truth&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A popular interpretation of Kumarila’s thesis has been this: cognitions are true unless shown otherwise.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:23&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:23&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (Alternatively, validity may only &lt;em&gt;entail&lt;/em&gt; truth.) K. K. Dixit, who adopts this interpretation, responds as one might then expect:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the difficulty with Kumārila’s argumentation is that a piece of cognition not proved to be invalid is not necessarily valid, it might be valid but it might as well be otherwise.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:24&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:24&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That would indeed seem to settle the matter. But this is an uncharitable interpretation, and is anyway at odds with the text: Kumārila several times allows that a false cognition may be valid.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:25&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:25&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;validity-as-commitment&quot;&gt;Validity as Commitment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Taber has defended another interpretation, the basic lines of which he attributes to Pārthasārathimiśra, another Mīmāmsā commentator.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:26&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:26&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; According to Taber, validity is not truth but rather as it were &lt;em&gt;commitment:&lt;/em&gt; “every cognition is accompanied by an initial sense of conviction; one is initially inclined to believe of every cognition that it is true.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:27&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:27&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But Taber rightly allows that Kumārila is concerned not only with psychology but also with what is &lt;em&gt;reasonable&lt;/em&gt;. Verse 60 tells us that when a cognition is not undermined, then “there is no reasonable ground for doubt.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:28&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:28&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; So we are supposed to be &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; in accepting our beliefs as a guide to how things actually are. Taber incorporates this point into his interpretation as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One continues to be so inclined as long as the cognition is not called into question. Almost certainly, however, if the cognition is never overturned, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; true. Falsehood cannot conceal itself forever. If, over the long run, the cognition is not shown to be false, then on the basis of its initial, intrinsic validity one is certainly &lt;em&gt;justified&lt;/em&gt; in believing that it is not false, that it is really true.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:29&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:29&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, for Taber, shows Kumārila adopting a kind of hard-headed empiricism: one may believe only that for which one has evidence; but, in addition, to have &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; evidence for something (to have no evidence that your view is wrong, for example) is to be warranted in thinking that no such evidence exists.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:30&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:30&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; To ask for more is in any case futile, since the demand only leads to regress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taber’s is one of the most sympathetic and careful interpretations of Kumārila on intrinsic validity, and there is much to like about it. But how can we take seriously the idea that a cognition never undermined is “almost certainly” true, a view that Taber says is “common sense”? Dixit’s comment is again apt: it might be true and then again it might not. Suppose, for instance, that, from a distance, I mistake for a woman a man whom I am unlikely to encounter again, and would not recognize if I did. The passage of time is unlikely to expose my error. This will often be a problem in practical life as well: it is often hard to know whether one has acted well. I could not possibly have a general expectation that advice—to buy fair-trade coffee, say—will, if bad, always, or almost always, ultimately be recognized as such. Taber himself actually raises roughly the same worry about Kumrila’s defense of the Vedas, namely that they seem to come out unscathed only by default.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:31&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:31&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But he seems to think that the worry is largely &lt;em&gt;restricted&lt;/em&gt; to the Vedic case, which, as my examples show, is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difficulty here is particularly acute for Taber because, although in vv. 47–8 Kumārila says that the validity of &lt;em&gt;valid&lt;/em&gt; cognitions is intrinsic, Taber’s view that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; cognitions are intrinsically valid, at least initially. This creates the impression that &lt;em&gt;every judgement&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;em&gt;prima facie&lt;/em&gt; justification or warrant. There is no good reason, on this view, why just any judgment should not be warranted, even if it’s formed on the basis of a dream or wishful thinking. Taber may say that Kumārila’s defense of the Vedas is unsuccessful because it makes Vedic injunctions valid just by default, but really that’s tantamount to an objection to the &lt;em&gt;svatah prāmānya&lt;/em&gt; thesis itself, on Taber’s interpretation thereof. The whole &lt;em&gt;point&lt;/em&gt; would be to make cognitions justified by default, despite the fact that many types and instances of judgements—including quite empirical judgements—cannot be supposed likely to be corrected if faulty.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:32&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:32&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;32&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taber’s interpretation draws attention to crucial but often overlooked features of Kumārila’s epistemology, including the lack of coincidence between truth and validity and the importance of warrant or justification. But Taber does not explain how warrant enters the picture; the interpretation falls into the same trap that Pārthasārathi’s does, and which other scholars have noted in that context: the theory reduces to a theory of judgement.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:33&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:33&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Taber has provided an argument for his claim that a cognition “compels our assent”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:34&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:34&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; only if that means merely that judgment &lt;em&gt;entails&lt;/em&gt; assent. We are offered no reason to suppose that it would be unreasonable to stop believing something upon realizing that one does in fact believe it, if one cannot then adduce some evidence for it. But Kumārila explicitly draws the conclusion that this &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; unreasonable.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:35&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:35&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, while Taber is right to say that the &lt;em&gt;svatah prāmāya&lt;/em&gt; thesis is separable from the doctrine of Vedic authority, the thesis is plainly motivated in great part by a desire to defend the possibility of Vedic (or ‘moral’ or ‘practical’) knowledge. Even if there are independent arguments—from the threat of regress, most obviously—it does not seem to me that we do Kumārila’s view much of a service if the realm of knowledge of most interest to him fares particularly poorly on his own epistemological theory.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:36&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:36&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;36&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Besides which, it is hard to imagine that Kumārila would rest his thesis on the idea that the passage of time makes a judgement more likely to be correct when this line of thought so clearly could not, &lt;em&gt;in principle&lt;/em&gt;, apply to the Vedic case, and which, indeed, would make validity &lt;em&gt;extrinsic&lt;/em&gt; in an obvious sense, since it would accrue with time. But Taber’s interpretation relies on this claim, for which the textual evidence is ambiguous at best.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:37&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:37&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two further points, besides those to which Taber draws attention, will help in constructing a better interpretation. The first stems from a bit of a puzzle. As noted, it seems that, on Taber’s interpretation, any judgement or belief whatever is supposed to be possessed of validity. He insists that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; cognitions are valid, unless sublated or otherwise brought into doubt by some further cognition—at which point they are not really cognitions anymore at all, because they have been abandoned psychologically. And that is a common reading of Kumārila. But the Mīmāmsās, like other schools, provide a list of the sources of knowledge or valid cognition—for the Mīmāmsās the list includes, among other things, perception, inference, and testimony.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:38&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:38&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;38&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But what would be the need for such a list if every cognition is automatically valid?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact Kumārila does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; think that every cognition is valid—mere fancies or wishful thoughts, for example, are not valid.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:39&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:39&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Kumārila also notably excludes memorial judgements from the realm of validity—only cognitions or judgments with novel contents are apt for validity.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:40&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:40&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;40&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; And although memories are, on Kumārila’s view, generally recognizable as such, it isn’t &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; obvious whether a judgment is memorial, since on the &lt;em&gt;Mīmāsā&lt;/em&gt; view mistaken judgements—formed, say, in a dream—&lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; effectively memorial events or collocations of memorial elements. So we cannot say that every judgement has intrinsic validity, or that any commitment we have is warranted barring some counter-indication. In which case we’ll need to find a way to understand how cognitions can be &lt;em&gt;intrinsically&lt;/em&gt; valid without severing the connection between &lt;em&gt;valid sources of cognitions&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;valid cognitions&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second point is this. The Mīmāmsās are strict about distinguishing the mental state which provides some awareness of the world (I will call this a first-order cognition) from the mental state which provides awareness of that first-order cognition (I’ll call this a second-order cognition).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:41&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:41&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;41&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Some Indian schools are in accord with Descartes: a cognition is itself present to consciousness as it reveals its object. Not so Mīmāmsā.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:42&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:42&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;42&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But the implications of this point for the &lt;em&gt;svatah prāmānya&lt;/em&gt; thesis have not been properly appreciated. In effect, we have &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; theses.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:43&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:43&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;43&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; One thesis concerns the status of the first-order cognition, and the second concerns the apprehension of that status by a second-order cognition. It may then be, for example, that only some cognitions &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; valid, but that every cognition, when apprehended, is &lt;em&gt;taken to be&lt;/em&gt; valid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my view the failure to appreciate this second point is partly responsible for the failure to appreciate the first. Tara Chatterjea, for example, though observing that the &lt;em&gt;svatah prāmāya&lt;/em&gt; thesis is really two theses, says that Kumārila makes “contradictory suggestions” concerning the scope of the &lt;em&gt;svatah prāmāya&lt;/em&gt; thesis, and identifies v. 53 as apparently claiming that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; cognitions are intrinsically valid, in contrast with e.g. v.47 which says only that &lt;em&gt;valid&lt;/em&gt; cognitions are intrinsically valid.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:44&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:44&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;44&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (Taber also relies on v. 53 in claiming that all cognitions are valid.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:45&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:45&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;45&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) But if v. 47 concerns the status of a cognition while v. 53 concerns the &lt;em&gt;assessement of&lt;/em&gt; the status of a cognition, then that is too quick. We may thus hope that care regarding these two points will make an adequate interpretation possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-new-interpretation-of-kumrilas-intrinsic-validity&quot;&gt;A New Interpretation of Kumārila’s Intrinsic Validity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the &lt;em&gt;Codanāsūtra&lt;/em&gt; is dense and difficult, I begin by describing my interpretation of Kumārila’s &lt;em&gt;svatah&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;prāmāya&lt;/em&gt; thesis in general terms. Then, interpretation in hand, I’ll take up exegesis in §[textualinterpretation].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Validity’ has, for Kumārila, as for most Indian philosophers, both a causal (or psychological) aspect and also a normative aspect; in India, as in the West, different understandings of perception were taken to have implications for what we can know, and epistemological commitments motivated views about mind and perception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginning with the psychological side, consider the idea, common in the history of philosophy, that experience confronts us with certain &lt;em&gt;appearances&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;ideas&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;impressions&lt;/em&gt; (though these appearances need not always be pictorial or visual in nature). One may hope that these appearances at least sometimes resemble or represent the world in some way. Locke, for example, thought that they sometimes did, and that we could sometimes be confident of this; the Stoics had a comparable view. Certain ancient skeptics thought that indeed our impressions &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; resemble or represent the world, but they argued that we can never know whether—and should not believe that—they do. Hume and Kant, in different ways, decided that the whole question was nonsense. Parallel positions existed in India concerning what we have called ‘cognitions.’ As in the early modern case, skepticism was more threat than reality, but Locke, Hume and Kant have their counterparts among Naiyāyikas, Buddhists, and idealists. And, as a start, we can think of Indian cognitions as being roughly equivalent to the West’s appearances or impressions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might think of cognitions or appearances as offering themselves for either acceptance or rejection. This is the view of some of Kumārila’s opponents—hence an objection considered by Kumārila to the effect that cognitions do not present themselves as authoritative.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:46&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:46&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;46&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; For Kumārila himself, on the other hand, a cognition does not simply present the cognizer with a view or thought which he might, but equally well might not, accept as his own. For Kumārila, to form a cognition is, as Taber says, already to view the world in the way portrayed by the cognition.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:47&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:47&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;47&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Kumārila’s case, the language of ‘appearance’ may in fact easily mislead. Taber employs such language too uncritically when he sees in Kumārila “a kind of rigid philosophical realism which insists strictly on the reality of appearances,” and when he says that the “emphasis on the inability to distinguish true from false cognitions expresses what seems an almost skeptical attitude on the part of Kumārila, viz., that we can never establish with absolute certainty that a cognition corresponds with reality.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:48&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:48&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;48&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This suggests that we stand back from, or in judgment of, cognitions, which Kumāriladoes not think is the normal case. It’s not so much that skeptical questions can’t be settled as that they don’t arise, precisely because, for Kumārila—and this much is uncontroversial—our cognitions just constitute the way we see things without any prior need for the passing of evidential judgments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider on the one hand a (representational) painting. One may appreciate it without supposing that what is represented there ever existed elsewhere. For most of us, on the other hand, a photograph or recording invites us to suppose that we are getting a bit of a glimpse of another time and place. Only when something seems off about the photograph do we feel the need to inspect it more carefully—when what is displayed seems very improbable, say, or when a face on the cover of a magazine is suspiciously free of wrinkles. But Kumārila’s cognitions are not like paintings &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; photographs. A photograph, like a painting, is something which stands apart from own way of seeing things, and Kumārila does not believe cognitions are like that. A better analogy for Kumārila’s cognitions would be a (very clean) window. One may realize that there is a window at the end of a hall because one has already seen through it to the trees beyond. If one realizes that there is a window, that is only because one has already looked through it. Likwise, the existence of a cognition is inferred from what is shown us by it, once we have already adopted it as part of our thinking.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:49&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:49&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;49&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was noted earlier that the ‘intrinsic validity’ thesis is really &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; theses, one about a first-order cognition and one about a second-order cognition. There are likewise two aspects of the thesis still considered as a psychological thesis, and we are now in a position to articulate these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ψα: Cognitions are transparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ψβ: The existence of a cognition is inferred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, as regards the first-order cognition, the claim (Ψα) is that it is the nature of cognitions to provide a window on the world, rather than a picture of it—to have a cognition just is, at least in the basic case, to have a view of the world. Regarding the second-order case, the point (Ψβ) is that one reads the existence of the first-order cognition off of the portion of the world thus revealed (you see the trees through the window, and because you can see trees you may infer that there is a window). The first-order cognition does not become an object of thought directly; it can be contemplated, indirectly as it were, without stepping back from the cognition or regarding it as something now in question, or as something which might now be rejected, since it is the very having of the view that makes it possible to recognize the cognition.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:50&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:50&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kumārila also claims that &lt;em&gt;invalidity&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;extrinsic&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;parata&lt;/em&gt;). If cognitions manifest the world rather than representing it, Kumārila nevertheless thinks that cognitions may err in various ways. We might again compare a window, which, even if clean and without impurities—so that we cannot inspect it directly—may yet be warped or tinted so that although we see the world through it and not in it, we see the world through it &lt;em&gt;wrongly&lt;/em&gt;. The thesis that invalidity is extrinsic emphasizes the point that even when a cognition portrays the world wrongly, we cannot consider it directly and note features of that cognition that are misleading, the way you could point out parts of a photo that may mislead. What you can do is form new cognitions, which may reveal that earlier cognitions were defective. Kumārila identifies two cases. First there is the case where you directly apprehend something as being different than you had thought: this is like looking out of a different window, seeing that it’s bright outside, and realizing that the first window had been tinted. Second there is the case where you realize that the first cognition was formed in some defective way: this is like being told that the windows are tinted and realizing that it must then be brighter out than you thought.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:51&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:51&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;51&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extrinsic invalidity thesis, regarded as a psychological thesis, may thus again be divided into two parts, corresponding to the first- and second-order cases respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ψα-: Cognitions do not contain signs of their own defeciencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ψβ-: One can only appreciate the deficiencies of a cognition through a further cognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thesis is that there is nothing in a cognition itself which could indicate a problem with it—a problem can only be indicated by another cognition, or by something turned up by another cognition (either because it reveals the world differently or because it reveals that the first cognition was formed in a problematic way). And second, for the very same reason, one can only &lt;em&gt;recognize&lt;/em&gt; a problem with a cognition on the basis of what is turned up by some further cognition. The difference between the two cases is that, in the first case, one might never even notice that one had possessed a cognition that was problematic: one might adopt a new view without ever noticing an evolution in one’s thinking, or one might wind up holding inconsistent views (i.e. one might retain the original view). In the second case, by contrast, the original cognition is &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt; to be defective. To see the old cognition as defective (as invalid) is already to have set it aside, and the new cognition which revealed the defectiveness of the first has thus become your new way of seeing the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kumārila sometimes appeals to the fact that a cognition is present and manifesting the world in a certain way as a reason for saying that cognitions are intrinsically valid.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:52&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:52&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;52&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But Kumārila also says that even invalid cognitions can manifest the world, at least until the error is noticed.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:53&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:53&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;53&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This point seems to have been overlooked (i.e. by interpreters who think that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; cognitions are—at least initially—valid) primarily on account of a failure to distinguish the first- and second-order cases.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:54&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:54&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;54&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Kumārila also assumes that once an error has been acknowledged, the erroneous cognition is set aside; thus a cognition will manifest the world in a certain way until it is recognized to be invalid. Thus again it has been supposed that validity and manifestation go hand in hand. But again this conflates the first- and second-order theses. A cognition could continue to manifest the world a certain way even after its invalidity has been revealed, if that invalidity has not been noticed (in the same way that you can learn something new without realizing that it undermines something else you believe). And there is another way that manifestation may come apart from validity. It is only cognitions derived from certain sources that can be valid: in particular valid cognitions derive from valid modes of knowledge. But you could see the world some way without having a view that is even apt for validity. (Memorial beliefs, for example, are not validity-apt.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:55&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:55&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;55&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) A cognition is intrinsically valid, then, neither in virtue of being accurate nor in virtue of manifesting (or pretending to manifest) the world. A cognition is intrinsically valid when it constitutes a genuine (though perhaps distorted) window on the world, in virtue of having a psychological or causal basis which allows it to be such a window. Cognitions arising from another source, however much they present or seem to present the world, and however accurately they do so, are not and cannot be valid, intrinsically or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Kumārila generally describes cognitions and validity in psychological or causal terms, he takes his account to have (what we would consider to be) normative implications, and we can consider Kumārila’s thesis to have a normative or evaluative aspect.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:56&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:56&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;56&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the normative side, we may understand validity as the status a cognition has when one is rationally entitled to it: I’ll call it ‘warrant’ or ‘entitlement.’ Once again there are two theses here, corresponding to the first- and second-order cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Φα: A cognition’s warrant does not depend on other cognitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Φβ: Seeing a cognition as warranted does not require seeing it as supported by other cognitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first-order case, the claim (Φα) is that the warrant of a cognition does not depend on its being buttressed by further cognitions. (Thus, for example, if you read in the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; that Hirut is beautiful, and come to believe that Hirut is beautiful, this belief does not require, for its warrant, that you have any other supporting belief—that the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; is a reliable source, say.) Second (Φβ), one may realize that one possesses no evidence (or no further supporting beliefs) for some belief without being rationally required to suspend or abandon that belief. Indeed, barring undermining evidence, it is irrational to reject your beliefs. (So, for example, suppose you realize that you believe Hirut is beautiful, but can’t remember how it is that you came by that belief. If you’re reasonable, and barring some more definite source of doubt, you will stand by this belief regardless.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say that invalidity is extrinsic again means two things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Φα-: a warranted cognition loses that warrant when some further cognition undermines it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for example, the belief that Hirut is beautiful will lose its warrant if you read that the reporter has been fabricating stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Φβ-: A cognition is properly judged unwarranted when it is seen to be undermined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you realize that the reporter discovered to have been fabricating stories is the reporter who wrote about the beautiful Hirut, then you will properly see the belief you had about the beautiful Hirut as unwarranted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cognition is not simply warranted by default. The warrant of a &lt;em&gt;warranted&lt;/em&gt; cognition is intrinsic in the sense described. But to have that status in the first place depends on the causal or psychological origin of the cognition. Hence the list of ‘valid’ &lt;em&gt;sources&lt;/em&gt; of cognition, or of warrant-grounding sources of cognition. Thus a cognition arrived at through testimony, inference, perception, or other sound basis of knowledge is warranted—though it may not be &lt;em&gt;correct&lt;/em&gt;, since not every belief derived from perception (say) is in fact veridical. A cognition originating merely in a dream or wishful thinking was never even warranted in the first place, though it may very well masquerade as a valid cognition, and as a cognition from a good source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How are the psychological and the normative aspects of &lt;em&gt;svatah prāmānya&lt;/em&gt; related? In Kumārila’s view, the various &lt;em&gt;pramānas&lt;/em&gt; are ways of opening up windows (in the form of cognitions) on the world. They don’t represent it but rather reveal it. This is what distinguishes the &lt;em&gt;pramānas&lt;/em&gt; from other sources of cognition such as wishful thinking or dreams—and even, in Kumārila’s view, from memory, which is parasitic on genuine &lt;em&gt;pramānas&lt;/em&gt;. And if this is how &lt;em&gt;pramānas&lt;/em&gt; work, it would be a mistake to distance yourself from your cognitions, as if they merely represented the world, or as if in looking around your surroundings you were only looking at something in your own head. A confused philosophical perspective on these matters leads to skepticism—it did so, or was thought to, in India as in the West—and a clear view ought to ward off that skepticism. Now of course sometimes we’re wrong about things—Kumārila doesn’t pretend otherwise. One often learns this in the ordinary course of things, as when one gets a closer view or a view in better light. But it is because cognitions open up the world to us the way they do that we can correct ourselves in that manner.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:57&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:57&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;57&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kumārila’s claim that cognitions are grasped as valid—the second-order intrinsic validity thesis—may give the impression that Kumārila is trying to help himself to evidence. But we can now see that grasping a cognition as being valid corresponds more closely to &lt;em&gt;reasonably believing something in a self-aware and occurrent manner&lt;/em&gt; than it does to &lt;em&gt;believing that a belief is reasonable.&lt;/em&gt; The latter—believing that a belief is reasonable—looks like it ought generally to be a response to some kind of evidence one can marshall regarding the belief in question (or its content). But that kind of reflective attention involved in &lt;em&gt;evaluating&lt;/em&gt; a belief is different from the reflective attention involved in simply &lt;em&gt;exploring&lt;/em&gt; one’s beliefs. Consider the familiar idea that, in order to figure out what one believes, one looks not inward but rather &lt;em&gt;outward&lt;/em&gt; towards the world—or the world as one sees it. Suppose I’ve seen Hirut, and I’m asked at some later point whether she is beautiful (or whether I believe that she is). I’ll think back to what she looked like, or try to frame her image in my mind, and then say “yes” or “no” depending on what I see there. There need be no question in this case of assessing evidence in any ordinary sense. I’m not going to review the visual conditions in which I first saw her, or anything like that. This is the case Kumārila is concerned with (and which he thinks is the normal case). And Kumārila’s claim then seems fair. This kind of reflection just assumes the reasonableness of the original belief, and it’s hard to see how else it could be. In Kumārila’s view there is no need to be concerned with the further question about the basis of one’s beliefs, so far as no particular cause for concern arises; indeed, if there were such cause for concern, you could never answer this simple question about whether Hirut is beautiful: the moment you thought back on Hirut your earlier cognition of her would have to be in doubt. Compare J. L. Austin on demanding how one knows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you say ‘That’s not enough’, then you must have in mind some more or less definite lack. ‘To be a goldfinch, besides having a red head it must also have the characteristic eye-markings’: or ‘How do you know it isn’t a woodpecker? Woodpeckers have red heads too’. If there is no definite lack, which you are at least prepared to specify on being pressed, then it’s silly (outrageous) just to go on saying ‘That’s not enough’.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:58&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:58&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;58&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That also helps us to make sense of the idea that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; cognitions may be taken as valid just in virtue of being cognitions. Sure enough, not every cognition &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; valid. But accepting it as valid doesn’t &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; it valid, either: Kumārila does not think that reflection renders a cognition valid any more than it renders cognition invalid, and neither does taking a cognition to be valid in any way establish that it is valid, or even imply that any evidence favors that cognition (unless such evidence as is manifested in that cognition already). It does not mean that warrant or evidence has &lt;em&gt;accrued&lt;/em&gt;. To put the point differently, we might say that Kumārila is interested rather in &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; justified than in &lt;em&gt;having&lt;/em&gt; a justification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, Kumārila’s view is that reasonable belief does not &lt;em&gt;require&lt;/em&gt; inquiry into evidence; it is no part of his view that there is anything &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; with such inquiry. We saw above that Taber attributed to Kumārila the idea that if no contrary evidence comes up then there must not be any. But whether or not that is Kumārila’s view, it is not part of the present doctrine. There is thus no willful blindness in this approach, though the Mīmāmsās’ larger aim of defending Vedic authority may create that impression. Kumārila’s view is not that testimony (for instance) ought always to be accepted unquestioningly. There are lots of reasons why one might distrust any given testimony, and likewise for other cognition-forming mechanisms. It is only that Kumārila gives no ground to skepticism. The fact is that quite often we know or can easily know plenty about the various ways we form our beliefs and about when further investigation is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;exegesis&quot;&gt;Exegesis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted, the &lt;em&gt;CS&lt;/em&gt; is a commentary on &lt;em&gt;MS&lt;/em&gt; I.i.2, which says that “duty is a purpose having injunction for its sole authority.” A number of the initial verses of the &lt;em&gt;CS&lt;/em&gt; are concerned with minor clarifications of that thesis, but vv. 5–6 are close to a statement of the chapter’s main theses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;5. Inasmuch as authoritative character [regarding duty] is possible only to the Word, [Śābara] has also pointed out the incapacity, with regard to such objects [necessary for knowledge of duty], of Sense-Perception and the rest, which is to be described hereafter.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;6. Even with regard to purely non-existing objects, the Word brings about some conception. And consequently, in the absence of any discrepancy, authoritative character must be accepted to belong to it by its very nature.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:59&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:59&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;59&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The later parts of the &lt;em&gt;CS&lt;/em&gt; are concerned more with the role and value of testimony as opposed to the other sources of knowledge alluded to here in v. 5, and the earlier portions (up to around v. 102) focus on the general epistemological theses (of interest to us) indicated in v. 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latter verse picks up on a common Mīmāmsā theme, namely the independence of testimony as a source of knowledge:&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:60&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:60&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;60&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; testimony produces cognitions, including of things non-existent, hence which could not have been produced by sense perception or any other &lt;em&gt;pramāna&lt;/em&gt;—and thus is a &lt;em&gt;primitive&lt;/em&gt; producer of cognitions, i.e. a &lt;em&gt;pramāna&lt;/em&gt; in its own right. Now this seems rather problematic. On the one hand Kumārila will not want to count just anything as a &lt;em&gt;pramāna&lt;/em&gt; merely because it leads us to think things. But if the point is rather (as I think it is) that testimony can (at least in the case of Vedic testimony regarding duty) provide us with a window on things that other &lt;em&gt;pramānas&lt;/em&gt; cannot, then the claim will be question-begging. But this is only a preliminary statement of the view (and fortunately we are not concerned with the case of testimony specifically), so we may simply note that a primitive cognition-producing mechanism is &lt;em&gt;eo ipso&lt;/em&gt; a producer of &lt;em&gt;valid&lt;/em&gt; cognitions. The starting-point for the discussion of &lt;em&gt;svatah prāmānya&lt;/em&gt; is an objection to the Mīmāmsās doctrine that an authorless text is our authority on &lt;em&gt;dharma&lt;/em&gt;, the nub of which objection Kumārila presents himself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;22. It is always an object perceived by other means of knowledge that is got at by the Word [testimony]; and, like memory, no authority can belong to it by itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When one accepts testimony, it is because “it is an assertion of a person who is believed to have perceived the object.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:61&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:61&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;61&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In other words, testimony is not a primitive source of knowledge like perception or inference are. The objector adds that we sometimes disregard testimony when we &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; judge the source reliable—and how could that be, if a reliable source isn’t in fact essential to testimony as a source of knowledge?&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:62&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:62&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;62&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The opponent also makes the objection I worried about a moment ago:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;25. “Thus then, as even when producing a conception, Fancy, &amp;amp;c., are no authorities by themselves, so we may apply the same rule to the case of Veda also.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, again, we do not want to say that just any psychological mechanism which produces some judgment is therefore to be accorded authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kumārila responds by broadening the inquiry, turning away from the specific case of testimony:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;33. With regard to all conceptions, you must consider the following question: “Is the authoritativeness or unauthoritativeness due to itself or to something else?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three possible positions besides Kumārila’s own:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;34. Because those that are by themselves false cannot by any means be proved to be true. Some people attribute both (authoritativeness and its contrary) to (the conception) itself. Others attribute them to the proved excellences or discrepancies of its origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first sentence Kumārila briefly hints at his reason for rejecting the view which will prove to be the principle rival to its own, namely that invalidity is intrinsic and validity extrinsic (he will return to it at v. 38ff, and we return to it on p.  below). The remaining possibilities are, first, that both validity and invalidity might be intrinsic to cognitions, and, second, that both might be extrinsic to cognitions. Verses 35–7 are devoted to rejecting these two possibilities. Regarding the first, Kumārila says that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;35. Both cannot be due to itself, because the two are mutually contradictory&lt;em&gt;$\ldotp\ldotp\ldotp\ldotp$ &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;36. How can it be possible that any one thing, independent of all extraneous agency, should have contradictory characters? …&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;37. If “non-contradictoriness” were possible with regard to different conceptions—even then, if nothing else is taken into consideration, it cannot be ascertained which is which, and where.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We might, uncharitably, see the argument of vv. 35–6 as turning on a confusion of type and token—after all, why shouldn’t some cognitions have the one character and other cognitions the other? Verse 37 would then acknowledge the confusion and offer a better argument. But that would be an unhelpful procedure, and v. 36 offers some textual basis for rejecting this reading. Verse 36 asks not just how cognitions could have contradictory characters, but specifically how anything could have contradictory characters &lt;em&gt;independently of all extraneous agency.&lt;/em&gt; If we were talking about a single cognition it would not matter whether or not extraneous agencies were implicated—a single thing could not be valid and invalid at the same time regardless. That suggests that even in vv. 35–6 Kumārila has in mind cognitions in general rather than particular cognitions—some cognitions will be valid and some invalid, but the difference has to be explained by further, external factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why should we have to appeal to extraneous factors to explain the difference? And what then is the real objection in vv. 35–6 to the possibility that both validity and invalidity might be intrinsic? A reasonable possibility is that Kumārila thinks that either validity or invalidity should be in some sense &lt;em&gt;natural&lt;/em&gt; to conceptions. But then only one or the other could be natural to cognitions in general, not both. Thus if validity were natural or intrinsic to cognitions then the invalidity of a given cognition would require some further explanation appealing to extrinsic factors. This interpretation would fit the language employed in the string of objections that are shortly posed. Thus 38: “for those that hold the authoritativeness of conceptions to be natural…”; v. 40: “if authoritativeness were inherent or natural…”; v. 44: “while unauthoritativeness, being natural….” So it seems reasonable to say, on the basis of vv. 35–6, that, for Kumārila, the question of the intrinsic or extrinsic nature of validity or invalidity is a question about the natural state of cognitions in general, the point then being that there could be (at most) only one such natural state. Remember that part of what of what Kumārila is considering is whether cognitions are presentative or rather &lt;em&gt;re&lt;/em&gt;presentative;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:63&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:63&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;63&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; here Kumārila is saying that at any rate they aren’t &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In v. 37 Kumārila sets aside the inquiry into cognitions in general. Now he considers the possibility that cognitions should be considered individually. Might some then be intrinsically valid and others invalid, just as there are both natural redheads and natural blondes? Kumārila now objects that “it cannot be ascertained which is which, and where.” The idea, I think, is this. The suggestion at hand is that some cognitions are presentative by nature and others representative.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:64&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:64&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;64&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But in Kumārila’s view, there remains an open question about the accuracy of a representation which does not arise in the case of a presentation. So the suggestion being considered in v. 37 is effectively a suggestion that sometimes cognitions arrive warranted, as it were, while other times cognitions are warranted only when supported or certified by another cognition. The “which is which and where” objection seems very much to the point: Kumārila’s thought would be that the suggestion just mooted undermines the possibility of intrinsic validity altogether—for how could you be warranted in accepting the intrinsically warranted cognitions if you can’t tell them apart from the ones that need to be certified by appeal to another cognition? A cognition that requires either buttressing or discarding must be discarded if you can’t buttress it; but if you can’t tell the cognitions to which that requirement applies apart from the cognitions to which it doesn’t, how can you be rationally required to stand by the latter, given that for all you know they must either be buttressed or discounted? True, there could still &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; intrinsically warranted beliefs—i.e. cognitions to which you are entitled even if they are not supported by other cognitions. But that entitlement would seem to disappear upon reflection.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:65&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:65&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;65&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Much of the epistemological benefit of understanding cognitions as presentative would thus disappear if it is only in the nature of &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; cognitions or types of cognitions to be presentative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the latter halves of vv. 35–6, Kumārila argues that validity and invalidity cannot both be &lt;em&gt;extrinsic&lt;/em&gt; to cognitions either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;35. … Nor can both be due to something else, because in this latter case, there would be no definiteness in the conception.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;36. … And when devoid of both these characters, of what form could the conception be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here Kumārila restricts his attention to individual cognitions, so if ‘being devoid of both characters’ would mean that a cognition is neither presentative nor representative, neither warranted nor unwarranted, then it’s unsurprising that Kumārila would dismiss this possibility. This seems to be confirmed when we look at what Kumārila means by saying that these cognitions would lack ‘form’ or ‘definiteness.’ Consider v. 168, which comes in the course of a discussion of sentence meaning and the importance of reliable speakers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;168. Though the meaning [of a sentence] may have been comprehended beforehand, yet it depends for its definiteness upon the fact of its originating directly from the [trustworthy] speaker’s cognition; hence such a fact can only be comprehensible through the comprehension of the meaning. But in the matter of authenticity, it takes the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems to say that while &lt;em&gt;understanding&lt;/em&gt; a sentence is simply a matter of sentence meaning, definiteness and authenticity (ie. validity) are a matter of the source of the belief in question. In any case the “definiteness” of a cognition seems to depend somehow on the causal origin of that cognition. What would that mean? It seems plausible to suppose that Kumārila is gesturing at the difference between merely entertaining a thought and having a thought that is delivered by some belief-producing mechanism which lends it weight (the latter corresponding to Kumārila’s cognition-producing mechanisms).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:66&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:66&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;66&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; For example, no one considering my hypothetical example of the beautiful Hirut is going to see something to actually believe in that—the example doesn’t assert that some Hirut is a beauty. But if one &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; that some Hirut is beautiful, the text would effectively present Hirut to you as beautiful. In the latter case the thought would be “definite.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considered from the perspective of warrant, the proposal in v. 168 may be urged against the idea that a cognition is warranted only if you can buttress it with some other cognition and that a cognition is also unwarranted only if it is undermined by some other cognition. For suppose that were true. Now you are reading a newspaper, and you read that a certain Hirut is beautiful. And suppose you have no particular reason for doubting this or for distrusting the newspaper. But you can only rationally adopt the belief that Hirut is beautiful if you can ground it in some other cognition. But also you can only reject it if you can oppose it with some other cognition. But then in what sense could this report be offering itself to you for acceptance, if you could accept it only by checking somewhere else for support first, but at the same time can’t rationally reject it either? Of course we could say that the newspaper is just offering you some things for consideration, but this would be exactly Kumārila’s point: you may as well have spent your morning daydreaming, if that’s all reading the newspaper gets you.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:67&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:67&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;67&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; [rival] The big question is whether validity is intrinsic and invalidity extrinsic, as Kumārila thinks, or the other way round. Verses 38–46 set out the position of Kumārila’s opponent, and some of the opponent’ reasons for saying that invalidity is intrinsic and validity extrinsic. One objection to Kumārila’s view is offered in v. 40:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;40. “If authoritativeness were inherent or natural and its absence artificial, then dream-cognitions would be authoritative, self-supported; for what is there to refute this?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is nearly a restatement of the objection of v. 25 within the new dialectical context: attention has shifted from modes of knowledge to cognitions. (There Kumārila had claimed that testimony—and thus Vedic testimony—is a source of knowledge since it produces cognitions, and the opponent had objected that cognitions are also produced by plainly problematic mechanisms.) Certainly from the perspective of warrant, the opponent’s view is intuitive: the thought is that, given all the defective ways cognitions can be formed, one can be warranted in thinking something only if one can recognize that one came by that thought in some sound way. My confidence in what I think should be affected, for example, by whether I read it in the &lt;em&gt;National Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; or on Wikipedia or in the &lt;em&gt;New York Review of Books&lt;/em&gt;, and that requires that I should have some appreciation of how my views originated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Kumārila’s response is also intuitive:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;49–51. If even on the birth of conception, the object thereof be not comprehended until the purity of its cause has been ascertained by other means, then in all cases we should have to wait for the production of another conception from a new source; for until its purity has been ascertained, the conception would be equal to nothing. And this second conception too, would be true only on the ascertainment of the purity of its cause; and so on and on, there would be no limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opponent thinks that the soundness of your view should turn on your appreciation of the soundness of the origins of your view—but to this sort of verification there is no end, for how can you trust that you have indeed properly assessed the origins of your original view? Your assessment itself might be wrong, and indeed according the opponent the assessment itself should be in doubt until verified. At that rate we will never be entitled to any beliefs.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:68&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:68&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;68&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though warrant is important here, Kumārila is more directly making a psychological point, as is especially evident from the two preceding verses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;47. You must understand that authoritativeness is inherent in all Means of Right Notion. For a faculty, by itself non-existing, cannot possibly be brought into existence by any other agency;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;48. since it is only for the sake of its birth that a positive entity requires a cause. And when it has once been born, it’s application to its various effects proceeds naturally out of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A valid cognition must of course have some causal basis, but once produced it provides comprehension of its object—that is what I take the reference to ‘faculty’ and ‘application’ to mean. Kumārila thinks that if the validity of a cognition—that, say, Hirut is beautiful—depends on some other cognition, then we would not after all have a comprehension of Hirut being beautiful until the further cognition were available. I understand the point here as follows. Suppose you pick up a copy of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times.&lt;/em&gt; In it you read a story about Ethiopia. The story is about a singer named Hirut and it reports that she is beautiful. Now suppose you know essentially nothing about the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, but also have no particular reason to doubt it or to doubt its reliability in this area. (Compare asking someone on the street for the time.) And in fact you come to believe, as a result of reading the story, that there is a beautiful Ethiopian singer named Hirut. Then assuming that the reporter is an honest and careful one, with sound aesthetic sensibilities, hasn’t the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; opened up a bit of the world for you? Doesn’t your new belief constitute a window on a little part of Ethiopia? This is what Kumārila claims is the case: a valid cognition is a window on the world, and nothing more than what has been described is required to open up that window.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:69&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:69&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;69&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does Kumārila say that once it has originated, the cognition thereby acts in this way (as this window), and that nothing could make it act this way if it couldn’t do so of it’s own accord? If we considered the matter in terms of &lt;em&gt;thoughts&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;beliefs&lt;/em&gt;, this would seem to be a mistake. Suppose another man reads the story about Hirut, but only in a detached fashion, forming no beliefs, because he dismisses the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; as a part of the reactionary old-media elite. The report that Hirut is beautiful opens no windows for him. But then he reads that the reporter in question supports some bold progressive cause—open borders, perhaps—and thus decides the reporter must be a trustworthy sort after all. He now remembers how this reporter said that a certain Hirut was beautiful, and now believes it. Doesn’t the initial thought about Hirut now serve as a window for him, though one opened by further thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we must remember that Kumarila’s cognitions are not beliefs as we understand them. A cognition is anchored to its genetic origin—to the particular episode of perceiving or of receiving testimony that gave rise to the cognition—in a way that a belief is not. Or again, validity, unlike justification, cannot be provided later for a cognition that lacked it. A cognition either captures a view of the world or it doesn’t, and if it doesn’t then nothing can change that later. You could later come by a new cognition that gives you what the first one might have, but that will just be a different cognition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if the validity of a cognition depends on other cognitions, then we’ll have a regress, while Kumārila’s view avoids that difficulty:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;52. In case, however, authoritativeness be accepted to be due to (the conception) itself, nothing else is wanted (for its cognition). Because in the absence of any cognition of discrepancies, falsity (unauthoritativeness) becomes precluded by itself (i.e. without the help of any extraneous Means).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:70&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:70&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;70&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note that Jhā—rightly—glosses ‘falsity’ here as ‘unauthoritativeness’—i.e. as invalidity. We return to ‘falsity’ in connection with v. 54 below.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verse 47 above said that validity is intrinsic to all &lt;em&gt;valid&lt;/em&gt; cognitions. But v. 53 has been cited by Taber to support the reading according to which &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; cognitions are intrinsically valid, and this pair of verses has also been adduced by Tara Chatterjea to show that Kumārila’s work contains “contradictory suggestions” concerning the scope of the &lt;em&gt;svatah prāmānya&lt;/em&gt; thesis.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:71&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:71&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;71&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Therefore the authoritative character of a conception, cognised through the mere fact of its having the character of “cognition,” can be set aside only by the contrary nature of its object, or by the recognition of discrepancies in its cause.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while the discussion (both mine and Kumārila’s) has thus far primarily concerned the first-order cognition, verses 52–3 connect up the first- and second-order elements of the intrinsic validity thesis. We remember that, for Kumārila, a cognition is not itself an object &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; consciousness, though it manifests some other object &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; consciousness. If you are aware of a cognition as opposed to its object, that is because this cognition has itself become the object of a &lt;em&gt;further&lt;/em&gt; cognition. The &lt;em&gt;svatah prāmānya&lt;/em&gt; thesis in this connection concerns the relationship between cognizing a cognition and cognizing that cognition as being (i.e. cognizing it as though it were) valid.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:72&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:72&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;72&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Verse 53 is asserting that the two are the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are cognitions apprehended as valid? Because to reflect upon a cognition just is to reflect upon the world which that cognition reveals. Such reflection presupposes that the initial cognition constitutes your view of the world. For suppose instead that, upon recognizing and attending to the belief that Hirut is beautiful, you were not to apprehend it as valid—whether actually as invalid or somehow as neither valid nor invalid. Then that very second-order cognition would undermine the first-order cognition. Even granting that the initial cognition were valid up to that point, there would now be a new cognition to the effect that the first cognition is invalid or false or doubtful or whatever the case may be. Of course this new cognition might itself be invalid, but that will not always be so, even when it is false. So reflection will be a way of undermining your cognitions, except to the extent that you are able to identify some support for them. But, thinks Kumārila, reflection should not undermine our beliefs in that way. So the two forms of the &lt;em&gt;svatah prāmānya&lt;/em&gt; thesis mesh nicely, and both are supported by the appeal to the threat of infinite regress. In v. 54 Kumarila identifies several varieties of invalidity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;54. Unauthoritativeness is three-fold: as being due to falsity, non-perception, and doubt. From among these, two (falsity and doubt) being positive entities, are brought about by discrepancies in the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the reference to ‘positive entities,’ Kumārila responds to ontological qualms of a pan-Indian variety concerning explanation; that need not detain us.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:73&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:73&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;73&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The reference to ‘discrepancies’ is more important for our purposes: the proponent of intrinsic invalidity will claim that a cognition is rendered valid when the mechanisms which produced it are seen to have been sound, whereas Kumārila claims that a cognition is shown invalid when the mechanism is shown to have been defective, i.e. to have had ‘discrepancies.’ In v. 54 Kumārila is thus cataloguing the ways in which a cognition can be rendered invalid and saying that two of these ways are indeed reducible to the the identification of discrepancies.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:74&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:74&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;74&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (The third, non-perception, will be a special case.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By ‘falsity,’ Kumarila means not the actual falsity or inaccuracy of the initial cognition; rather he is addressing the case in which some such inaccuracy is turned up, or in which some defect in the mechanism behind the cognition is turned up, so that the initial cognition is altogether overturned. The case of doubt requires not so much an overturning as an unsettling; thus in a stock Indian example you might be unsure whether you’re looking at (or saw) a piece of silver or rather a bit of shell. Kumārila is considering these two cases in vv. 57–61:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;57. Unauthoritativeness (falsity) is got at directly through the “Cognition (of its contradictory).” For, so long as the former is not set aside, the subsequent cognition (of its contradictory) cannot be produced.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;58. Though the cognition of the discrepancy of the cause is known to refer to a different object (&lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt;, not the object which is the effect of tlie cause), yet we have co-objectivity (of the two cognitions) as being implied thereby; and hence we have the preclusion of the former,—as in the case of the “milking-pot.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:75&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:75&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;75&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;59. But this rule applies only to those cases in which (with regard to the second conception) there is neither cognition of any discrepancy, nor any contradictory conception. In those cases, however, in which we have any of these two factors, the second conception becoming false, the first comes to be true.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;60. But in that case too, the authoritativeness is due to the conception itself, in the absence of any cognition of discrepancies. And in a case where there is no such cognition of discrepancies, there is no reasonable ground for doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;61. Thus (in this manner) we do not stand in need of postulating more than three or four conceptions. And it is for this reason that we hold to the doctrine of “Self-evidence” [i.e. &lt;em&gt;svatah prāmānya&lt;/em&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‘falsity’ case well illustrates one form of the extrinsic nature of invalidity. It is in having the new cognition that the earlier one is set aside and rendered invalid. And should the new cognition itself prove faulty, the original cognition is valid again not because it has gained new support but because the objections have been lifted—thus the validity of a valid cognition is intrinsic even if it loses and regains that status.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:76&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:76&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;76&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not just a psychological point. It may be that, as a psychological matter, it’s impossible to credit both the old idea that Hirut is beautiful and the new idea that she’s plain, but as a psychological matter one could reject the new information rather than the old. But, for Kumarila, the new cognition is itself intrinsically valid, barring some further problem with &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt;. The process of discarding the old way of looking at things is, moreover, an inferential process and not merely a causal one. This is clearest in the case where a cognition is not just straightforwardly at odds with the earlier cognition in terms of its content, but where the new cognition reveals something problematic about the causal basis of the original cognition, which is the case Kumarila considers in v. 58. For an example, imagine that rather than seeing Hirut and finding her plain, you learn that the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; reporter in question has abnormal aesthetic sensibilities. And notice, finally, that v. 60 above is explicit that there is a question of rationality here: it would be a &lt;em&gt;mistake&lt;/em&gt; to give up your view of Hirut’s beauty barring some specific reason for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When in the case of ‘falsity’ a cognition is set aside, it is, in a sense, not really even apt for validity any more, since it no longer constitutes one’s view of the world anyway. Likewise with the case of doubt; the view has been suspended in a way that would make it inappropriate to ask, for example, whether the subject is justified in holding it.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:77&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:77&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;77&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The same point holds doubly for the case of non-perception, the case in which you were simply not in contact with the world at all, as might be the case in dreams, or the aforementioned case of ‘fancy,’ or wishful thinking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In the case of non-perception, however, we do not admit the action of such discrepancies. Because for us all non-perception is due to the &lt;em&gt;absence&lt;/em&gt; of cause,—just as you have asserted.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This case is important because it illustrates a claim I’ve made a couple of times, namely that cognition must have a certain causal origin if it was ever to have validity in the first place. ‘Fancy’ and wishful thinking, for example, are not sources of valid cognition,&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:78&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:78&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;78&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but only special cases of non-perception. We remember that v. 48 had said that it was only for its birth that a positive entity required a cause—here there is no (sound) cause in the first place, and no positive entity (i.e. no valid cognition). This implicitly offers a response to the dream objection of v. 40.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The non-perception case also allows us to appreciate more clearly that validity cannot be anything like &lt;em&gt;truth.&lt;/em&gt; If I daydream the beautiful Hirut into existence, and later forget it was a daydream and come actually to believe that there was a beautiful Ethiopian singer named Hirut, the belief may or may not in fact be &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;; Ethiopia has its singers, Hirut is a reasonably common name there, and it is a land of beautiful women; some woman may very well be all of these things. But there is no question or possibility of &lt;em&gt;validity&lt;/em&gt; here. Validity requires a causal basis (such as testimony or perception) that can (though may not always) mediate some kind of contact between you and the word. If there’s no actual chain between the world and your thoughts about it, you can’t have valid cognitions about it. Kumārila applies his conclusions to the case of testimony:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;64. In (truthful) human (speech) we find two (factors)—&lt;em&gt;absence of discrepancies,&lt;/em&gt; and (&lt;em&gt;presence of&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;em&gt;excellence&lt;/em&gt;; and we have already explained that authoritativeness cannot be due to &lt;em&gt;excellence&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;65–6. Therefore excellences must be held to help only in the removal of discrepancies; and from the absence of these latter (discrepancies), proceeds the absence of the two kinds of unauthoritativeness; and thus the fact of (authoritativeness) being inherent in Words remains untouched. And inasmuch as the word gives rise to a conception, its authoritativeness is secured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Kumārila says it has already been explained that validity cannot be due to the excellences of testimony, he must mean that a cognition is not valid in virtue of &lt;em&gt;recognizing&lt;/em&gt; that the source of knowledge—in this case testimony—was free of fault. He exploits this point to respond to the objection that his own view does face a regress despite his earlier protestations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;“If the absence of discrepancies be held to result from excellences, then there is the same &lt;em&gt;regressus ad infinitum&lt;/em&gt; (that you urged against us.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;67. (Not so): because at that time (ie. at the time of the conception of the absence of discrepancies), we do not admit of any active functioning of the excellences, though they continue to be recognised all the same;—because in the conception of the absence of discrepancies they help by their mere presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we have seen before, one need not actually have an appreciation of the soundness of the basis of a conception for it to be valid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a slight puzzle here, though, because v. 67 seems to suggest that in fact a valid cognition &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; have a &lt;em&gt;sound&lt;/em&gt; basis—i.e. a source without discrepancies. But that cannot be right, because it would mean that testimonial cognitions are not after all valid just as such, and, as we can see even here (from the the last sentence of vv. 65–6), validity &lt;em&gt;does not&lt;/em&gt; depend on the actual faultlessness of the testimony in question: testimony just as such &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a source of valid cognitions. I therefore take v. 67 to mean that the &lt;em&gt;presumed&lt;/em&gt; excellences of the source of a cognition suffice (so far as the source is of an approved variety: testimony, perception, etc.). This is further confirmed by the next verses, as we turn to the case of the Vedas, where Kumārila claims that the very testimonial nature of Vedic-derived cognitions imbues them with validity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;70. Hence the mere fact of the Veda not having been composed by an authoritative author, ceases to be a discrepancy&lt;em&gt;$\ldotp\ldotp\ldotp\ldotp$ &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;71. It is only human speech that depends for its authority upon another Mean of Right Knowlede; and hence in the absence of the latter, the former becomes faulty; but the other (ie. Vedic sentences) can never be so (on that ground).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have returned here to the second-order case: testimonial cognitions may be presumed sound just on the basis of being testimonial cognitions, though in the typical or human case, where testimonial knowledge is parasitic on other sources of knowledge, that presumption would be overruled by the observation that the testifier had no way of coming by his supposed knowledge. In the case of the Vedas, no such difficulty can arrive, and the presumption stands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verse 72 returns us to the matter of independence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Thus then, the very fact of the incompatibility of the Veda with other Means of Right Notion, constitutes its authoritativeness; for if it were not so incompatible, it would only be subsidiary (to other such means).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point here is that since Vedic testimony produces cognitions which could never be called into question by any other source of knowledge, the Vedas are an authority: they produce cognitions which must be trusted. This may seem to reopen our question about dreams and fancies. Perhaps you have dreams about the future, and come to have beliefs about the future in that way, and these beliefs cannot be undermined by perception or inference. Does that make dreaming authoritative concerning the future? Kumārila does not think so, but not, I think, for deep reasons of epistemological theory proper. It is just that dreaming and Vedic testimony are different cases. On Kumārila’s view, dreams and fancies just take the matter of perception and mix it up in arbitrary ways; they are not new sources of information. One could, of course, say the same about the Vedas—but then you wouldn’t be a &lt;em&gt;Mīmāmsāka&lt;/em&gt;. Kumārila thinks that language and meaning are deep and primitive aspects of the cosmos, that the cosmos is eternal, that it’s reasonable to suppose that the Vedas were never written, and that they tap into eternal meanings somehow. Those are matters separate from epistemology, nor does Kumārila suppose himself to have defended any of those claims at this stage.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:79&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:79&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;79&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; We pass over vv. 73–81, which continue discussing the independence of Vedas, and arrive at an objection in v. 82:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;82. (Objection): “But Sense-Perception and the rest are not comprehended as that ‘these are authoritative’; nor is it possible to carry on any business by means of such perceptions, when they are not comprehended as such.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opponent objects that since in forming cognitions we do not yet have any confidence in those cognitions, they cannot be a basis for action or further inference. In responding, Kumārila provides a helpful recapitulation of his view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;(Reply): Even prior to comprehension, the Means of Right Notion had an independent existence of their own and they come to be comprehended subsequently (as such), through other cognitions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cognition is valid and serves as a basis for action and inference even without any recognition of its existence; when its existence is recognized, this is in a new cognition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;84. Therefore the fact of its being comprehended as such, does not in any way help the authoritativeness (of the Means of Right Notion); because the idea of the object is got at through the former alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second-order recognition of a cognition as valid is not necessary for the validity of that first-prder cognition, nor can it confer validity upon it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Even the unauthoritative Means would, by itself, lead to the conception of its object; and its function would not cease unless its falsity were ascertained by other means.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even an invalid cognition manifests the world, though it may do so wrongly (it may for example ‘reveal’ a real shell to be a piece of silver&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:80&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:80&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;80&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;), but until it is revealed as misleading it is accepted, and forms a basis for further inference. Notice here that a cognition can be invalid but still manifest the world. We should also see here a connection to action: so far as v. 85 itself goes, we might think that the ‘function’ of a cognitions was restricted to manifestation, and that may indeed be the primary meaning, but in the context of the objection of the objection at v. 82, Kumārila evidently means that, in virtue of the exercising its function, a cognition (even an invalid one) functions as a basis for action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally we end with a reiteration of the intrinsicality of validity and the extrinsicality of invalidity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;86. The falsity of an object is not, like its truthfulness, perceived by its very first conception. For the recognition of unauthoritativeness, the only cause is one’s consciousness of the falsity of its subject itself, or of he faultiness of the cause thereof.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;87. Thereby alone is falsity (of a conception) established; and by no other means. And the truthfulness (or authoritativeness of a conception) is proved to &lt;em&gt;belong to the state of its birth&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt;, is natural or inherent in it).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;88. Therefore even in cases where falsity is proved by other means, these two (causes of falsity) should be noted, and not only certain points of similarity (with another false idea).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have clarified a number of puzzles about the text that remained in other interpretations, and found confirmation for the approach I laid out in the previous section. We have reaped these rewards primarily by simply attending carefully to the difference between the first- and second-order aspects of the &lt;em&gt;svatah prāmāya&lt;/em&gt; thesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kumrilas-conception-of-knowledge&quot;&gt;Kumārila’s Conception of Knowledge&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we wish to sympathize with Kumārila’s theory rather than only to set it out, it will be helpful to conclude by looking briefly at a couple of historical comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For analogies with Kumārila’s intrinsically valid cognitions, Taber adduces Descartes’ “clear and distinct ideas,” the truth of which are self-evident, and, again, the Stoic’s notion of a ‘&lt;em&gt;φαντασία καταληπτική&lt;/em&gt;,’ an impression or appearance which contains some mark guaranteeing its own truth or accuracy.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:81&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:81&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;81&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Taber grants that, in contrast with &lt;em&gt;kataleptic&lt;/em&gt; impressions or clear and distinct ideas, intrinsically valid cognitions are common; on Taber’s interpretation all cognitions are at least initially intrinsically valid. But the more important disanalogy, which Taber must himself insist on, but nevertheless seems really to &lt;em&gt;spoil&lt;/em&gt; the analogy, is that intrinsically valid cognitions needn’t be true, whereas the whole point of the Stoic and Cartesian notions is to isolate a special class of impressions or ideas which are sure to be such. J. N. Mohanty is, I think, right in saying that the whole spirit of Kumārila’s view is to &lt;em&gt;reject&lt;/em&gt; the notion of self-evidence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it is precisely the contention of the &lt;em&gt;svatahprāmānya&lt;/em&gt; theory…that &lt;em&gt;there is no criterion of truth, though there are criteria of error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:82&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:82&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;82&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nearer Hellenistic counterpart for Kumārila is Philo. According to what seems to be the dominant reconstruction, Philo, who led the Academy for some time, was initially a radical skeptic in the manner of Clitomachus, then later adopted the mitigated skepticism of Metrodorus, and finally in his (unfortunately not extant) ‘Roman Books’ advocated a sort of fallibilism.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:83&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:83&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;83&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The Academics seem to have generally accepted (if only for the purpose of launching counter-arguments) the Stoic understanding of knowledge, which required the afore-mentioned &lt;em&gt;kataleptic&lt;/em&gt; impressions: knowledge requires an accurate impression appropriately caused by what it represents, and which contains some mark which shows that it meets those two conditions. The Academics argued that there were no such impressions, since any true impression could be mimicked by a false one. The skeptics, like the Stoics, thought that one ought not to assent to what one does not know; thus a radical skeptic would ideally refuse ever to assent to anything. A mitigated skepticism, on the other hand, would allow the reasonableness of forming some beliefs even without allowing the existence of a criterion of truth; some appearances might at least constitute good, if never conclusive, evidence. But ultimately Philo reinterpreted the notion of a &lt;em&gt;kataleptic&lt;/em&gt; impression, accepting the requirements of truth and of a suitable causal basis, but removing the requirement that such an impression guarantee its own truth, which he still considered to constitute an impossible standard. This meant that it might not only be reasonable to form beliefs but that &lt;em&gt;kataleptic&lt;/em&gt; impressions were after all possible, and one might rationally accept these without qualificaton. But since the requirement for a criterion of truth had been abandoned, one might very well be mistaken about whether one actually possessed a &lt;em&gt;kataleptic&lt;/em&gt; impression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philo’s innovation provoked a good deal of hostility. He had, in effect, given up the idea that knowledge must be certain (or infallible)—something assumed by dogmatists and skeptics alike. Kumārila’s validity does not require truth, but, like Philo, he decided that the reigning epistemic standard was impossible for any cognition to attain, and thus redefined it so that it could be claimed as a matter of course, as it properly should have been. As with Philo’s view, this view was met by complaints from outside Kumārila’s own school and with disbelief from inside it. Thus a later commentator, Umbeka, found a way interpret Kumārila as making validity entail truth after all. In India, as in the Hellenistic world, knowledge was supposed to be infallible, and Kumārila’s innovation, like Philo’s, lies precisely in giving up that requirement as in any case impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both cases, the reinterpretation of knowledge is at least in part a response to the demands of practical activity. A major criticism of the radically skeptical position was that it made action and virtue impossible, since both require belief. Efforts were made to reconcile action with the skeptics’ traditional refusal to assent, but the mitigated skeptical position amounted to a way of allowing assent without admitting the possibility of knowledge or certainty. Since the mitigated position winds up buying into dogmatic conception of knowledge in a way that radical skeptics could claim to avoid (the latter could more easily claim to ‘accept’ it only to attack it), the Philonian position can be understood as an attempt to just find a new understanding of knowledge that was a better fit with the practical considerations driving the mitigated skeptics’ concessions in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kumārila likewise reinvents the notion of knowledge to allow for the demands of practice. Moral or &lt;em&gt;dharmic&lt;/em&gt; knowledge will be impossible without the authority of Vedic texts—the Buddhists, for example, are wrong to suppose that perception will suffice. But Vedic testimony cannot meet the standards imposed by the epistemological theories of other schools, which would require either a kind of self-evidence of which no cognition is capable, or verification which is in this case impossible. How then would one pursue &lt;em&gt;dharma&lt;/em&gt;? Human beings must act, and they must have moral guidance. It cannot be unreasonable to act as best you can, relying on the best resources available, even if the soundness of these resources cannot be established. That is part of what it is to be reasonable, and the standards of theoretical reason are misconceived if they seem to say otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

Meaning has not (I hope) been affected. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For a survey of the school see e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;#keith1921karma&quot;&gt;Keith (1921)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:4&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Śābarabhāsya&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;ad loc.&lt;/em&gt; Though he notes that Mīmāmsākas must still rule out other potential ways of knowing &lt;em&gt;dharma&lt;/em&gt;, for example by inference or analogy. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:5&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The restriction to matters invisible was taken seriously by Mīmāmsā: what the Vedas said about anything other than &lt;em&gt;dharma&lt;/em&gt; was reinterpreted or disregarded.[invisiblenote] &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:5&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:6&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I leave aside the part about the eternal connection between words and meanings, which would take us too far afield. Suffice it to say that the Mīmāmsākas spilt a good deal of ink developing an ontology and a philosophy of language to make room for the idea of testimony that is authoritative but authorless. See &lt;a href=&quot;#tabereternality&quot;&gt;Taber&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:6&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:8&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Thus &lt;a href=&quot;#pollock1989mima&quot;&gt;Pollock (1989, p. 606)&lt;/a&gt;, who argues that Mīmāmsā itself encouraged the rejection of history. But there was already fertile soil, e.g. in the cyclical conception of the universe. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:8&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:10&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#matilal1986perception&quot;&gt;Matilal (1986, p. 32)&lt;/a&gt;; see &lt;a href=&quot;#arnold2001ivr&quot;&gt;Arnold (2001, pp. 589–91)&lt;/a&gt; on the modern reception of the doctrine of &lt;em&gt;svatah prāmānya&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:10&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:11&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Testimony (&lt;em&gt;śabda&lt;/em&gt;) is sometimes treated under the heading of ‘injunction’ (&lt;em&gt;codanā&lt;/em&gt;) because the Mīmāmsā school is concerned with Vedic testimony insofar as it offers prescriptions for living, whether in a grammatical form or not (see also n. [invisiblenote] above). In our passages, Kumārila is explicitly treating &lt;em&gt;śabda&lt;/em&gt; in general (vv. 7–8). &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:11&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:13&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Thus v. 68: “Then, too, in the case of the Veda, the assertion of &lt;em&gt;freedom from reproach&lt;/em&gt; is very easy to put forward, because there is no speaker in this case; and for this reason the unauthoritativeness of the Veda can never even be imagined.” &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:13&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:14&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;vv. 13–8. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:14&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:15&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#taber1992dkb&quot;&gt;Taber (1992)&lt;/a&gt; [p. X]. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:15&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:16&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;vv. 47–8; cf. e.g. vv. 6, 80. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:16&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:18&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;So for example Prabhākara before Kumārila, and Umbeka, Pārthasārathi, and Sucarita after him—see &lt;a href=&quot;#chatterjea2003svatah&quot;&gt;Chatterjea (2003)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;#taber1992dkb&quot;&gt;Taber (1992)&lt;/a&gt; for brief accounts. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:18&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:19&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The usage goes back at least to &lt;a href=&quot;#keith1921karma&quot;&gt;Keith (1921)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;#radhakrishnan1927indian&quot;&gt;Radhakrishnan (1927)&lt;/a&gt;, and is employed in the recent discussions of Kumārila offered by &lt;a href=&quot;#taber1992dkb&quot;&gt;Taber (1992)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;#arnold2001ivr&quot;&gt;Arnold (2001)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:19&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:20&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;E.g. vv. 49–51. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:20&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:21&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;E.g. vv. 52–3, 56, 86–7. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:21&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:22&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Even with Kumārila it’s not trivial to rule out a pragmatic understanding. Karl &lt;a href=&quot;#potter1984die&quot;&gt;Potter (1984)&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;#potter1992presuppositions&quot;&gt;Potter (1992)&lt;/a&gt;] has argued that ‘knowledge’ has &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; more a pragmatic than a theoretical import in Indian philosophy—but see &lt;a href=&quot;#mohanty1984pramanya&quot;&gt;Mohanty (1984)&lt;/a&gt;. A pragmatic understanding of validity was read into the &lt;em&gt;SV&lt;/em&gt; itself by Sucarita Miśra, a later Mīmāmsā commentator—see &lt;a href=&quot;#chatterjea2003svatah&quot;&gt;Chatterjea (2003, pp. 52–3)&lt;/a&gt;. My own interpretation gives a role to pragmatic considerations; cf. also &lt;a href=&quot;#bhatt1962epistemology&quot;&gt;Bhatt (1962)&lt;/a&gt; [pp. XX]. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:22&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:23&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Assuming a correspondence understanding of truth. But scholars of Indian philosophy also often use ‘truth’ as a label of convenience, and thus may describe Kumārila’s thesis in these terms without subscribing to the interpretation now under consideration. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:23&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:24&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#dixit1983slokavarttika&quot;&gt;Dixit (1983, p. 5)&lt;/a&gt;; for validity as truth see also e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;#chatterjea2003svatah&quot;&gt;Chatterjea (2003)&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;#hiriyanna1932outlines&quot;&gt;Hiriyanna (1932)&lt;/a&gt;; among traditional authors see e.g. Gangeśa, &lt;em&gt;PV&lt;/em&gt; [XX]. &lt;a href=&quot;#bhatt1962epistemology&quot;&gt;Bhatt (1962)&lt;/a&gt; interprets validity as truth-entailing, but understands intrinsicality in a way that would avoid Dixit’s complaint; classically, cf. Umbeka &lt;em&gt;SVVT&lt;/em&gt; [XX]. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:24&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:25&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Thus &lt;em&gt;CS&lt;/em&gt; v. 6 (trans. Jhā): “Even the unauthoritative Means would, by itself, lead to the conception of its object, and its function could not cease unless its falsity were ascertained by other means.” Cf. e.g. vv. 85–6. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:25&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

For other suggestions in terms of presumptive or &lt;em&gt;prima facie&lt;/em&gt; truth see &lt;a href=&quot;#keith1921karma&quot;&gt;Keith (1921, p. 18)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#dasgupta1957history&quot;&gt;Dasgupta (1957, pp. 372–5)&lt;/a&gt;, who offers a coherentist spin, and &lt;a href=&quot;#bhatt1962epistemology&quot;&gt;Bhatt (1962)&lt;/a&gt; [pp. 131ff.]. &lt;a href=&quot;#chatterjea2003svatah&quot;&gt;Chatterjea (2003, p. 52)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;#mohanty1989gangesa&quot;&gt;Mohanty (1989, p. 8)&lt;/a&gt; also suggest that—at least in Pārthasārathi’s case—the claim is a psychological one.

      &lt;p&gt;Taber (p. 215, n. 56) cites v. 80 in support of the idea that the passage of time improves confidence, but while the verse shows that Kumārila is trying to make more than a psychological point, I cannot see in it any indication that he is thinking about the passage of time, except in the trivial sense that a counter-indicating cognition would come after the initial cognition. Taber also adduces &lt;em&gt;TS&lt;/em&gt; 2904, but again I see in that verse only the claim that cognitions are valid if they’re not upset by other cognitions. Kumārila refers in this verse to cognitions occurring at “other times and places,” but that doesn’t mean that length of time (or travel experience, for that matter) makes a difference to warrant except insofar as counter-indication cognitions would, by their nature, have to occur at other times.[tabertextual] &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:32&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Thus &lt;a href=&quot;#mohanty1989gangesa&quot;&gt;Mohanty (1989, p. 8)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;#chatterjea2003svatah&quot;&gt;Chatterjea (2003, p. 52)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:33&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;v. 60; cf. vv. [XX], &lt;em&gt;TS&lt;/em&gt; 2872–4. Taber himself acknowledges the importance of this point.[reasonableness] &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:35&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:36&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A complicating factor here is the Mīmāmsā adherence to the view (very contentious in the Indian setting) that ‘absence’ (&lt;em&gt;abhāva&lt;/em&gt;) is a sound means of acquiring knowledge. That is, one may rightly infer from the absence of any indication of something that it doesn’t exist. But this principle makes no appeal to the passage of time, and Kumārila is liberal and reasonable about what counts as an indication of a real or potential difficulty about evidence. Taber does not rely on an appeal to &lt;em&gt;abhāva&lt;/em&gt; in his defense of &lt;em&gt;svatah prāmānya&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:36&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;We must leave aside the details of Kumārila’s theory of perception, which would also take us into his metaphysics and philosophy of language, but a translation of the relevant chapter of the &lt;em&gt;SL&lt;/em&gt; (the &lt;em&gt;Pratyaksapariccheda&lt;/em&gt;), along with extensive notes and discussion, has recently been provided by &lt;a href=&quot;#taber2005hindu&quot;&gt;Taber (2005)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:50&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:54&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The other factor is perhaps the failure to see the connection between the validity of means of knowledge and the validity of cognitions. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:54&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:57&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It is particularly characteristic of the Indian tradition to (as we would see it) transform normative or evaluative questions into epistemological or metaphysical questions, so far as possible. Most notoriously, there seems to have been virtually no direct philosophical inquiry into final ends—no ethics or moral philosophy in the Western sense. The introduction has already given an illustration of the kind of thing that happened instead: debates about final ends were fought by proxy, in terms of epistemology, ontology, perception, language, and so on, with each school developing an increasingly sophisticated philosophical apparatus to buttress their approach to duty or liberation. See further &lt;a href=&quot;#sen1984concept&quot;&gt;Sen (1984)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:57&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:59&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Jhā refers to ‘cognitions’ as ‘conceptions’; ‘validity’ is ‘authoritativeness’; `intrinsic is ‘inherent’; Jhā also uses ‘means of right notion’ to refer to a valid cognition. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:59&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:64&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At least that’s how Kumārila, a realist, would look at the matter. As indicated in §[interpreting] above, other Indian philosophers would have seen the matter differently. It’s not clear that Kumārila is really trying to seriously respond to such views as opposed to just considering all of the possibilities in a realistic spirit. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:64&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:65&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At present we are asking a question about the warrant of the first-order cognition, and not a question about how it can be &lt;em&gt;determined&lt;/em&gt; whether a first-order cognition is warranted. But one part of the suggestion in the contemplated scenario is that some cognitions may be warranted only &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; assessed in a certain way. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:65&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:70&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cf. v. 56: “The fact of mere Unauthoritativeness being due to discrepancies does not lead to any &lt;em&gt;regressus ad infinitum&lt;/em&gt;—as is found to be the case with the theory of the cognition of excellences (being the cause of authoritativeness)—for us who hold the theory of “self-evidence” [&lt;em&gt;svatah prāmānya&lt;/em&gt;].” &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:70&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#mohanty1989gangesa&quot;&gt;Mohanty (1989, p. 3)&lt;/a&gt; offers a useful note on the difference between (and different positions on) grasping ‘&lt;em&gt;prakāśa&lt;/em&gt;’ and grasping ‘&lt;em&gt;prāmānya&lt;/em&gt;,’ and see &lt;a href=&quot;#sen1984concept&quot;&gt;Sen (1984)&lt;/a&gt; for a more extensive treatment. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:72&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:74&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Notice it’s not enough for there to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; discrepancies—they must be turned up somehow. Otherwise those cognitions would not have been valid in the first place, and Kumārila is claiming that they were. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:74&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:75&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:77&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A doubt carries no commitment in any direction in the first place—this point fits with my earlier discussion where I supposed that validity presupposses &lt;em&gt;definiteness&lt;/em&gt; as I interpreted that term; cf. &lt;a href=&quot;#bhatt1962epistemology&quot;&gt;Bhatt (1962, pp. 93–5)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:77&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:79&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Verse 70 in its entirety runs thus: “Hence the mere fact of the Veda not having been composed by an authoritative author, ceases to be a discrepancy.

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abstract-label&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/span&gt;. I articulate the Socratic understanding of &lt;em&gt;techne&lt;/em&gt;—expertise—and argue that, for Socrates, &lt;em&gt;techne&lt;/em&gt; is knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-introduction-socrates-as-an-epistemologist&quot;&gt;I. Introduction: Socrates as an Epistemologist&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the layman is asked, “give me an example of something you know,” he will tend to produce examples apt for rendering in propositional form: “two plus two equals four,” or “Addis Ababa is the capital of Ethiopia.” He could, with equal propriety, mention some of his skills—“carpentry” or “how to play the piano”—but he doesn’t. Contemporary epistemologists also address the latter sorts of cases only exceptionally or secondarily. The emphasis is rather on knowledge of particular facts. Thus a recent introductory text in epistemology can open by saying flatly that “knowledge is constituted by belief.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; One would not merely assume such a thing of the carpenter’s knowledge, or of the pianist’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Socrates, by contrast, gravitated in his philosophizing toward the examples provided by the skilled, typically professional practices known to the Greeks as ‘τέχναι.’ His contemporaries noticed this fondness. Xenophon records the Athenian tyrants, concerned about the bad light being shed on their ability as rulers, issuing Socrates a warning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;ὁ δὲ Κριτίας, ἀλλὰ τῶνδέ τοί σε ἀπέχεσθαι, ἔφη, δεήσει, ὦ Σώκρατες, τῶν σκυτέων καὶ τῶν τεκτόνων καὶ τῶν χαλκέων: καὶ γὰρ οἶμαι αὐτοὺς ἤδη κατατετρῖφθαι διαθρυλουμένους ὑπὸ σοῦ.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“You see, Socrates,” explained Critias, “you will have to avoid your favourite topic,—the cobblers, builders and metal workers; for it is already worn to rags by you in my opinion.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That fondness is also manifest in Plato’s earlier dialogues,&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and is likewise noted there (again with exasperation):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;νὴ τοὺς θεούς, ἀτεχνῶς γε ἀεὶ σκυτέας τε καὶ κναφέας καὶ μαγείρους λέγων καὶ ἰατροὺς οὐδὲν παύῃ, ὡς περὶ τούτων ἡμῖν ὄντα τὸν λόγον.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Callicles: By the gods! You simply don’t let up on your continual talk of shoemakers and cleaners, cooks and doctors, as if our discussion were about them!&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We, too, are apt to be surprised at some of Socrates’ invocations of τέχναι in connection with all manner of epistemological matters. So, for example, when it is suggested by Critias in the &lt;em&gt;Charmides&lt;/em&gt; that temperance (σωφροσύνη) is knowing oneself (τὸ γιγνώσκειν αὐτόν), Socrates promptly suggests that temperance will then be analogous to medicine.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be hard, then, to altogether fail to notice the presence of τέχνη in Plato’s early dialogues. Nevertheless, scholars have largely failed to appreciate the epistemological significance it has there. In particular, it has not been appreciated that Socrates’ reflections on τέχνη—which make up a significant part of the dialogues—constitute a distinctively Socratic set of reflections on the nature of knowledge. My aim in this paper is to rectify this: I will argue that there is a distinctively Socratic conception of τέχνη which constitutes a distinctively Socratic (or early Platonic) conception of knowledge .&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this thesis means is, first, that Socrates has a distinctive conception of τέχνη considered in its own right. Scholarly discussion of τέχνη in the early dialogues has largely centred on the so-called “craft analogy”—the supposed Socratic analogy between virtue and τέχνη—and this emphasis on the relationship between τέχνη and virtue has generally been at the expense of attention (or disinterested attention) to the nature of Socratic τέχνη proper. It is not often noticed that there even is a specifically Socratic conception of τέχνη. Terence Irwin, author of perhaps the most important recent book on Plato’s moral theory, tells us that “Socrates does not say exactly what he takes to be implied by saying that something is a craft [i.e. a τέχνη] or is similar to a craft.” That is not altogether unfair, but Irwin then goes too far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Aristotle, however, has a fairly clear and explicit view of the character of a craft. It is useful, then, to replace the rather imprecise question ‘Does Socrates treat virtue as a craft?’ with the more precise question ‘Does Socrates treat virtue as the sort of thing that Aristotle regards as a craft?’&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Socrates certainly says enough about τέχνη to distinguish his conception thereof from Aristotle’s, as well as from later Platonic understandings and from understandings mooted in other literature and by other characters in Plato’s dialogues.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, my thesis means that Socrates is interested in, and has something distinctive to say about, epistemology. This is not always recognized: so great and sympathetic an interpreter as Gregory Vlastos was able to say that Socrates was “exclusively a moral philosopher.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:9&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:9&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But this is an untenable position if we keep firmly in mind the fact that τέχνη is at the very least a &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt; of knowledge—indeed in these dialogues ‘τέχνη’ is frequently synonymous with ‘ἐπιστήμη’ (itself commonly translated as ‘knowledge’). Socratic theorizing about τέχνη is epistemological theorizing, and Socrates does a great deal of it: he considers, for example, the nature of the objects of knowledge (the subject matter of a true τέχνη—&lt;em&gt;Laches&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ion&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Gorgias&lt;/em&gt;), the characteristics of, and how to identify, the knower (the expert or τεχνίτης—&lt;em&gt;Ion&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Euthyphro&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Gorgias&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Protagoras&lt;/em&gt;), the value and efficacy of knowledge (&lt;em&gt;Euthydemus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hippias Major&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Gorgias&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Protagoras&lt;/em&gt;), and the psychological role of knowledge (&lt;em&gt;Hippias Minor&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Protagoras&lt;/em&gt;). True, Socrates does not discuss our preferred cases—but neither do we discuss his. It is also true that Socrates is first of all concerned with virtue. The situation in Plato’s early dialogues is nicely captured in Socrates’ own response to the tyrants, as reported by Xenophon: if he cannot discuss “cobblers, builders and metal workers,”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;οὐκοῦν, ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης, καὶ τῶν ἑπομένων τούτοις, τοῦ τε δικαίου καὶ τοῦ ὁσίου καὶ τῶν ἄλλων τῶν τοιούτων;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Then must I keep off the subjects of which these supply illustrations, Justice, Holiness, and so forth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is a motive for, not a bar to, the pursuit of epistemology.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:10&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:10&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, it is my thesis that, for Socrates, knowledge is τέχνη. Even on those occasions when the topic of Socratic epistemology &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; taken up in its own right, τέχνη is not recognized to have this epistemological significance. A common view is that Socratic knowledge is something like &lt;em&gt;understanding&lt;/em&gt;. But that positive suggestion misleads. Consider Hugh Benson’s “paradigmatic examples of the kind of understanding [Benson has] in mind”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We say things like Einstein understands gravity, Richard Feynmann understands quantum mechanics, R. G. Collingwood understands history, or James Boswell understands Samuel Johnson.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:11&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:11&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these are not like Socrates’ own examples. Callicles does not complain that Socrates never leaves off talking about cosmological theories; the tyrants do not warn Socrates that he should stop talking about historical figures. It is doubtful whether Socrates would even accept that there is such a thing as knowledge of history or people.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:12&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:12&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He rejects Ion’s representation of himself as an expert on Homer and &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; on Homer, and I see no reason why he should take a different view of “understanding Johnson.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:13&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:13&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Again, Socrates is hilariously dismissive of Hippias’ historical ‘knowledge’ in the &lt;em&gt;Hippias Major&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:14&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:14&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The Einstein and Feynman examples are better insofar as they are meant to suggest the mastery of some general, atemporal domain. On the other hand, insofar as the examples are meant to suggest a special, perhaps even unique, insight, they are best avoided. For example, it has been said of Ramanujan that “if [he] had any peers in the formal manipulation of infinite series, they were only Euler and Jacobi.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:15&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:15&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But if it is also true that Ramanujan “never comprehended the idea of proof,”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:16&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:16&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; then he would be a poor example of a Socratic expert: the Socratic expert is supposed to be able to explain himself, and to teach what he knows.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:17&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:17&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Indeed Ramanujan seems to have said about himself what Socrates says about Ion: his inspiration was divine. Now the point is not that Socrates is uninterested in understanding, or that he would deny that Benson’s people know (or understand) what Benson says they do. The point is rather that Socrates is only interested in understanding—or any other kind of knowledge—insofar as it is an aspect of τέχνη.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I proceed as follows. In §II, I explain what τέχναι are, and describe some of the contentious issues surrounding the concept. This will allow us to better understand Socrates’ own conception of τέχνη, and how it differs from other conceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In §III, I show that knowledge attributed to others by Socrates should generally be understood as manifesting τέχνη-possesion—for example, a man might know that so-and-so has such-and-such an ailment, and how to treat it, because he is a doctor. I also argue that, for Socrates,  is not rooted in any other form of knowledge—it is not partially or wholly constituted by prior factual knowledge, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In §IV, I acknowledge that there are Socratic attributions and avowals of knowledge that do not fit within the τέχνη-scheme. But I argue that these instances are trivial reflections of the fact that Plato wrote in a colloquial style. Only in the case of τέχνη do we find any serious epistemological theorizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In §V, I conclude that, for Socrates, knowledge is τέχνη. In suport of this conclusion, I also provide some examples of Socrates’ tendency to treat any kind of question about knowledge as a question about τέχνη.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ii-texnh-and-socratic-texnh&quot;&gt;II. Texnh and Socratic Texnh&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;iii-in-general&quot;&gt;II.i. τέχνη in general&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;τέχναι, as noted, were skilled, often professional, practices. Building or carpentry (τεκτονία) was a pardigmatic case; the cobbling, metal-working, shoemaking, and medicine we encountered earlier are likewise good examples, and others would include mathematics and musical arts. For the possessor of a τέχνη and the possession of a τέχνη respectively, ‘expert’ and ‘expertise’ are good fits. For the body of knowledge itself, as opposed to the mastery thereof, there is no very good English equivalent. In the context of Plato’s dialogues, ‘τέχνη’ has been translated variously as ‘craft,’ ‘skill,’ ‘expertise,’ ‘art,’ ‘science,’ and ‘profession,’ none of which is ideal. ‘Profession’ entails earnings, which is too strong. ‘Skill’ is too broad, as is ‘know-how’: Harold Shipman was an skillful killer, but his τέχνη was medicine, which &lt;em&gt;imparted&lt;/em&gt; that skill; again, one knows how to walk up stairs, but that is neither an expertise nor a τέχνη, nor in this case even a manifestation of one. ‘Science,’ ‘art,’ and ’craft’ are the nearest English equivalents, especially on older (obsolete?) understandings; they are still sometimes good fits in particular cases (e.g. ‘the science of medicine’; ‘the carpenter’s craft’; ‘the art of programming’), though each has nowadays too narrow a range in general. With that qualification understood, I will sometimes employ ‘craft’ or ‘art.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since people need and rely upon experts, ‘τέχνη’ was a term of commendation. As such, there was dispute about whether given practices deserved the title, and various considerations were adduced in support on one or the other positon.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:18&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:18&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; A simple example is provided in the &lt;em&gt;Laches&lt;/em&gt;, which opens with two generals in disagreement about whether “fighting in armour” is a τέχνη. Nicias identifies various likely advantages to studying this art, but Laches wonders whether there is really anything here to study at all:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;ἀλλ᾽ ἔστι μέν, ὦ Νικία, χαλεπὸν λέγειν περὶ ὁτουοῦν μαθήματος ὡς οὐ χρὴ μανθάνειν: πάντα γὰρ ἐπίστασθαι ἀγαθὸν δοκεῖ εἶναι. καὶ δὴ καὶ τὸ ὁπλιτικὸν τοῦτο, [182ε] εἰ μέν ἐστιν μάθημα, ὅπερ φασὶν οἱ διδάσκοντες, καὶ οἷον Νικίας λέγει, χρὴ αὐτὸ μανθάνειν: εἰ δ᾽ ἔστιν μὲν μὴ μάθημα, ἀλλ᾽ ἐξαπατῶσιν οἱ ὑπισχνούμενοι, ἢ μάθημα μὲν τυγχάνει ὄν, μὴ μέντοι πάνυ σπουδαῖον, τί καὶ δέοι ἂν αὐτὸ μανθάνειν;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It’s hard to say of any study whatever that it shouldn’t be learned, because it seems good to know everything, and in particular this skill in arms, if it’s really the subject of study its teachers claim and Nicias says; but if it’s not a subject of study and those who profess it are practicing a deception, or if it is a subject of study but not a very serious one, why learn it?&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:19&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:19&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laches inclines to the more sceptical view: he says that the practicioners of this supposed art have not shown themselves of any value in battle—this is his own experience, and confirmed by the fact that the Spartans (who ought to know) do not employ any of these fighters in armour. A basic expectation of a τέχνη, then, is that it can accomplish something; if the practicioners of a purported τέχνη cannot demostrate such accomplishments, then it is doubtful whether there is any such τέχνη.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, a τέχνη was expected to provide &lt;em&gt;reliable&lt;/em&gt; success. Reliability was in turn commonly supposed to hinge on the precision (ἀκρίβεια) attainable by a τέχνη. In the &lt;em&gt;Philebus&lt;/em&gt;, for example, Socrates distinguishes two varities of (“so-called”) τέχναι: on the one hand there are ‘τέχναι’ practiced with a low degree of precision (ἀκρίβεια) which would thus be less reliable (they possess much unclarity, “σμικρὸν δὲ τὲ βέβαιον”);&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:20&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:20&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; on the other hand there are those practices—τέχναι properly speaking—which employ numbers and weights and measures:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;οἷον πασῶν που τεχνῶν ἄν τις ἀριθμητικὴν χωρίζῃ καὶ μετρητικὴν καὶ στατικήν, ὡς ἔπος εἰπεῖν φαῦλον τὸ καταλειπόμενον ἑκάστης ἂν γίγνοιτο.… τεκτονικὴν δέ γε οἶμαι πλείστοις μέτροις τε καὶ ὀργάνοις χρωμένην τὰ πολλὴν ἀκρίβειαν αὐτῇ πορίζοντα τεχνικωτέραν τῶν πολλῶν ἐπιστημῶν παρέχεται.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Socrates: If someone were to take away all counting (ἀριθμητικός), measuring (μετρητικός), and weighing (στατικός) from the arts and crafts, the rest might be said to be worthless.… As to building (τεκτονική), I believe that it owes its superior level of craftsmanship over other disciplines to its frequent use of measures (μέτρα) and instruments, which give it high accuracy (ἀκρίβεια).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:21&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:21&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Mark Schiefsky observes, the presentation of this point suggests that it was not original, and Felix Heinimann, who has explained that number, weight, and measure were a standard triad of features defining τέχνη, likewise says that “Platon hat die Scheidung zwischen den unexakten und den mit Zahl und Mass arbeitenden Künsten offenbar übernommen.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:22&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:22&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just how much reliability or success should be expected of a τέχνη was a matter of dispute.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:23&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:23&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Any given ‘expert’ might of course fail at a task, if only from inexperience or lack of aptitude. The difficulty arose when even the most skilled practitioners of the so-called τέχνη were liable to failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a trope to the effect that when you call the builder you will get a house—and you won’t get a house otherwise.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:24&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:24&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But other putative craftsman aren’t always successful. Doctors don’t always restore people to health, and, what’s more, people sometimes regain health without the aid of doctors. On such grounds some denied that medicine was a τέχνη at all.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:25&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:25&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The orator or sophist, too, was susceptible to such charges, especially given the boast that he could teach nothing less than virtue. Again it was observed that these teachers were not always successful (how interesting that a teacher of virtue should insist on securing payment up front!), and that their students were sometimes surpassed by the untrained.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:26&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:26&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that some doctors accepted the terms of this challenge, and claimed to meet it. One Hippocratic text, &lt;em&gt;On Regimen in Acute Dieseases&lt;/em&gt;, claims of the study of regimen that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;καὶ γὰρ τοῖσι νοσέουσι πᾶσιν ἐς ὑγείην μέγα τι δύνασθαι, καὶ τοῖσιν ὑγιαίνουσιν ἐς ἀσφαλείην, καὶ τοῖσιν ἀσκέουσιν ἐς εὐεξίην, καὶ ἐς ὅ τι ἂν ἕκαστος ἐθέλῃ.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;To the sick it is a powerful aid to recovery, to the healthy a means of preserving health, to athletes a means of reaching their best form and, in short, the means by which every man may realize his desire.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:27&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:27&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we’ll run into it again, it’s worth noting that the “all or nothing” attitude underlying this challenge and defence is surprisingly common in the history of medicine. We also find it in Chinese and Indian medical texts, for example.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:28&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:28&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Even a widely-employed modern version of the Hippocratic Oath calls upon doctors to avoid the trap of “those twin traps of over-treatment and therapeutic nihilism [i.e. the view that medical treatment is useless or harmful, either in general or in a particular sphere];”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:29&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:29&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that such a warning should be necessary is testament to the enduring force of the view that medicine should be able to do anything if it is not worthless.&lt;!-- (As an indication of how general this temptation is, we may note the absence of a convenient English word for ‘a lack of success’ which doesn’t also carry a tone of censure.)--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A somewhat more modest and more sophisticated medical response to the reliability challenge is offered in &lt;em&gt;De Arte&lt;/em&gt;, another Hippocratic text. We are told that nature (φύσις) sets limits on what is possible for the medical art. Thus fire is the ultimate cauterizer available to medicine, and if this cauterizer is sometimes insufficient, that is no fault of medicine. The doctor still knows what ailments are amenable to treatment, and what to do in those cases. It is significant that φύσις is said to set the limits here. Τέχνη was often viewed as a way of mastering or overcoming τύχη—i.e. chance or luck.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:30&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:30&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The author of &lt;em&gt;De Arte&lt;/em&gt; can say that medicine, like any good τέχνη, is indeed insurance against the vicissitudes of fortune, but that while the doctor will understand the inexorable workings of nature, he could not be expected to resist them.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:31&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:31&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Indeed, medicine has been singled out quite unfairly; what has been said about medicine’s reliance on available resources goes just as well for other τέχναι:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Other crafts are exercised on materials on which mistakes can easily be rectified, as is the case with those which employ wood or hides…. but the craft cannot be practised at all if one of the materials be missing.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:32&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:32&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;32&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;De Arte&lt;/em&gt; still offers us an impressively demanding standard for τέχνη: James Allen observes that the author “seems to envisage… a physician who will at no point undertake cures with less than complete confidence of success,”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:33&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:33&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and indeed that is explicitly the point: we are told that the aims of medicine, which it “does accomplish… and is ever capable of,” are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the complete removal of the distress of the sick, the alleviation of the more violent diseases and the refusal to undertake to cure cases in which the disease has already won the mastery, knowing that everything is not possible to medicine.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:34&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:34&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;De Arte&lt;/em&gt; acknowledges that doctors do sometimes make incorrect diagnoses and prescribe ineffective therapies, but these failures are due to patient error of one kind or another.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:35&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:35&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The doctor can then claim, not absolute power over disease, but still perfect precision and reliability—which is all any τέχνη could claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author of &lt;em&gt;De Arte&lt;/em&gt; again has company. Thus Glaucon in the &lt;em&gt;Republic&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;κυβερνήτης ἄκρος ἢ ἰατρὸς τά τε ἀδύνατα ἐν τῇ τέχνῃ καὶ τὰ δυνατὰ διαισθάνεται, καὶ τοῖς μὲν ἐπιχειρεῖ, τὰ δὲ ἐᾷ: ἔτι δὲ ἐὰν ἄρα πῃ σφαλῇ, ἱκανὸς ἐπανορθοῦσθαι. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A first-rate captain or doctor… knows the difference between what his craft can and can’t do. He attempts the first but lets the second go by, and if he happens to slip, he can put things right.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:36&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:36&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;36&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And such a view has again been a recurring one in the history of ideas. For example, Albert Schweitzer reported in the 1920s that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;in the opinion of the Black Africans the efficacy of medicine is demonstrated primarily in that the physician knows whether the patient will die or not, and in that the physician does not apply his art to someone who is really already dead.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:37&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:37&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears to remain influential in modern societies: according to a 1977 discussion of the attitudes and expectations of doctors, “patients who defy diagnosis, or who obstinately refuse to get better tend to be regarded as ‘awkward’, ‘attention-seeking’, or ‘neurotic’.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:38&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:38&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;38&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third approach to reliability is suggested by the author of a third Hippocratic text, &lt;em&gt;On Ancient Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. He is seemingly willing to countenance principled limits on the precision available to doctors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;δεῖ γὰρ μέτρου τινὸς στοχάσασθαι. μέτρον δὲ οὔτε ἀριθμὸν οὔτε σταθμὸν ἄλλον, πρὸς ὃ ἀναφέρων εἴσῃ τὸ ἀκριβές, οὐκ ἂν εὕροις ἀλλ᾽ ἢ τοῦ σώματος τὴν αἴσθησιν. διὸ ἔργον οὕτω καταμαθεῖν ἀκριβέως, ὥστε σμικρὰ ἁμαρτάνειν ἔνθα [20] ἢ ἔνθα. κἂν ἐγὼ τοῦτον τὸν ἰητρὸν ἰσχυρῶς ἐπαινέοιμι τὸν σμικρὰ ἁμαρτάνοντα. τὸ δὲ ἀτρεκὲς ὀλιγάκις ἔστι κατιδεῖν.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One must aim at a measure (μέτρον); but you will find no measure (μέτρον)—nor number (ἀριθμόσ) nor weight (σταθμόσ) besides—by referring to which you will know with precision (ἀκρίβεια), except the feeling of the body. Hence it is difficult to acquire knowledge so precise (ἀκριβῶς) that one errs only slightly in one direction or the other. And I would strongly praise this doctor, the one who makes only small errors; perfect accuracy (τὸ ἀτρεκές) is rarely to be seen.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:39&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:39&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author of the here indicates that medicine, like any proper , is possessed of a μέτρον, while also observing that not every μέτρον allows for equally easy attainment of precision. In that case, a doctor could be wrong or off sometimes or to some degree and still be a genuinely good doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is Aristotle who first plainly states what I take to be the proper view. He points out early in the &lt;em&gt;Nicomachean Ethics&lt;/em&gt; that “precision (τὸ ἀκριβές) is not to be sought for alike in all discussions, any more than in all the products of the crafts (ἐν τοῖς δημιουργουμένοις),” and says that “it is the mark of an educated man to look for precision (τὸ ἀκριβές) in each class of things just so far as the nature (φύσις) of the subject admits.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:40&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:40&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;40&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He elaborates on the thought later:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;ἐκεῖνο δὲ προδιομολογείσθω, ὅτι πᾶς ὁ περὶ τῶν πρακτῶν λόγος τύπῳ καὶ οὐκ ἀκριβῶς ὀφείλει λέγεσθαι, ὥσπερ καὶ κατ᾽ ἀρχὰς εἴπομεν ὅτι κατὰ τὴν ὕλην οἱ λόγοι ἀπαιτητέοι: τὰ δ᾽ ἐν ταῖς πράξεσι καὶ τὰ συμφέροντα οὐδὲν ἑστηκὸς ἔχει, ὥσπερ οὐδὲ τὰ ὑγιεινά. τοιούτου δ᾽ ὄντος τοῦ καθόλου λόγου, ἔτι μᾶλλον ὁ περὶ τῶν καθ᾽ ἕκαστα λόγος οὐκ ἔχει τἀκριβές: οὔτε γὰρ ὑπὸ τέχνην οὔθ᾽ ὑπὸ παραγγελίαν οὐδεμίαν πίπτει, δεῖ δ᾽ αὐτοὺς ἀεὶ τοὺς πράττοντας τὰ πρὸς τὸν καιρὸν σκοπεῖν, ὥσπερ καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς ἰατρικῆς ἔχει καὶ τῆς κυβερνητικῆς.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But this must be agreed upon beforehand, that the whole account of matters of conduct must be given in outline and not precisely (ἀκριβῶς), as we said at the very beginning that the accounts we demand must be in accordance with the subject-matter; matters concerned with conduct and questions of what is good for us have no fixity (οὐδὲν ἑστηκὸς ἔχει), any more than matters of health. The general account being of this nature, the account of particular cases is yet more lacking in exactness (ἀκριβής); for they do not fall under any art (τέχνη) or precept but the agents themselves must in each case consider what is appropriate to the occasion, as happens also in the art of medicine (ἡ ἰατρική [τέχνη]) or of navigation.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:41&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:41&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;41&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that medicine is for Aristotle a genuine τέχνη, despite its admitted lack of precision. The idea is that an expert works with materials not themselves provided by his knowledge, so knowledge alone cannot ensure success. We ought then to distinguish &lt;em&gt;competent application of methods&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;successful outcome&lt;/em&gt;, or the &lt;em&gt;exercise&lt;/em&gt; of an art from the thereof.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:42&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:42&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;42&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Such distinctions may seem obvious, but centuries later we still find Alexander of Aphrodisias (2nd–3rd c. AD) urging these Aristotelian points against the the Stoics,&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:43&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:43&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;43&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and we’ve also seen that doctors needed reminding of them as recently as 1977.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another point of occasional disagreement concerned the proper or necessary theoretical basis of the requisite precision and reliability. For example, the author of &lt;em&gt;VM&lt;/em&gt; observes that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;λέγουσι δέ τινες ἰητροὶ καὶ σοφισταί, ὡς οὐκ εἴη δυνατὸν ἰητρικὴν εἰδέναι ὅστις μὴ οἶδεν ὅ τί ἐστιν ἄνθρωπος. ἀλλὰ τοῦτο δεῖ καταμαθεῖν τὸν μέλλοντα ὀρθῶς θεραπεύσειν τοὺς ἀνθρώπους. τείνει δὲ αὐτοῖς ὁ λόγος ἐς φιλοσοφίην, καθάπερ Ἐμπεδοκλῆς ἢ ἄλλοι οἳ περὶ φύσιος γεγράφασιν ἐξ ἀρχῆς ὅ τί ἐστιν ἄνθρωπος, καὶ ὅπως ἐγένετο πρῶτον καὶ ὁπόθεν συνεπάγη.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;some doctors and sophists say that it is impossible for anyone to know medicine who does not know what the human being is; anyone who is going to treat patients correctly must, they say, learn this. Their account tends towards philosophy, just like Empedocles or others who have written about nature from the beginning, what the human being is and how it originally came to be and from what things it was compounded.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:44&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:44&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;44&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He replies that medicine is in its own right a source of knowledge about nature, and indeed prior to the kind of knowledge envisioned by these other thinkers.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:45&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:45&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;45&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The author’s own view is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;ἐπεὶ τοῦτό γέ μοι δοκεῖ ἀναγκαῖον εἶναι ἰητρῷ περὶ φύσιος εἰδέναι καὶ πάνυ σπουδάσαι ὡς εἴσεται, εἴπερ τι μέλλει [20] τῶν δεόντων ποιήσειν, ὅ τί τέ ἐστιν ἄνθρωπος πρὸς τὰ ἐσθιόμενά τε καὶ πινόμενα καὶ ὅ τι πρὸς [p. 54] τὰ ἄλλα ἐπιτηδεύματα, καὶ ὅ τι ἀφ᾽ ἑκάστου ἑκάστῳ συμβήσεται, καὶ μὴ ἁπλῶς οὕτως: πονηρόν ἐστιν βρῶμα τυρός. πόνον γὰρ παρέχει τῷ πληρωθέντι αὐτοῦ, ἀλλὰ τίνα τε πόνον καὶ διὰ τί καὶ τίνι τῶν ἐν τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ ἐνεόντων ἀνεπιτήδειον.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This I think is what it is necessary for a doctor to know about nature (φύσις) and to make every effort to know, if he is going to do any of the things that he must: what the human being is in relation to foods and drinks, and what it is in relation to other practices, and what will be the effect of each thing on each individual—not simply that ‘cheese is harmful food, for it causes trouble to one who has eaten too much of it’, but rather what trouble, and why, and which of the things in the human being it is inimical to.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:46&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:46&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;46&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Schiefsky sums up the view thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The author’s position is clearly quite different from that of the [later] Empiricists. Like them, he rejects certain kinds of theorizing as speculative and irrelevant to medicine. But unlike them he insists that medicine must be based on an explanatory theory of human  that makes reference to factors that cannot be observed directly.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:47&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:47&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;47&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another example of a dispute on this point in the &lt;em&gt;Gorgias&lt;/em&gt;, where Socrates is unsatisfied with Polus’ statement that “it is experience that causes our times to march along the way of craft (τέχνη), whereas inexperience causes them to march along the way of chance (τύχη).”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:48&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:48&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;48&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He says that when some practice “has no rational account by which it applies the things it applies, to say what they are by nature, so that it cannot say what is the explanation of each thing,” then that practice is merely a product of experience (ἐμπειρία), and not a τέχνη. Socrates goes on: “I don’t call anything a craft which is unreasoning (ἄλογος)” (465a). He derides Polus’ own ‘τέχνη’ of rhetoric, comparing it to “cookery,” which “by habit and experience…keeps only memory of what usually happens.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:49&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:49&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;49&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;ἔλεγον δέ που ὅτι ἡ μὲν ὀψοποιικὴ οὔ μοι δοκεῖ τέχνη εἶναι ἀλλ᾽ ἐμπειρία, ἡ δ᾽ ἰατρική, λέγων ὅτι ἡ μὲν τούτου οὗ θεραπεύει καὶ τὴν φύσιν ἔσκεπται καὶ τὴν αἰτίαν ὧν πράττει, καὶ λόγον ἔχει τούτων ἑκάστου δοῦναι, ἡ ἰατρική: ἡ δ᾽ ἑτέρα τῆς ἡδονῆς, πρὸς ἣν ἡ θεραπεία αὐτῇ ἐστιν ἅπασα, κομιδῇ ἀτέχνως ἐπ᾽ αὐτὴν ἔρχεται, οὔτε τι τὴν φύσιν σκεψαμένη τῆς ἡδονῆς οὔτε τὴν αἰτίαν, ἀλόγως τε παντάπασιν ὡς ἔπος εἰπεῖν οὐδὲν διαριθμησαμένη, τριβῇ καὶ ἐμπειρίᾳ μνήμην μόνον σῳζομένη τοῦ εἰωθότος γίγνεσθαι, ᾧ δὴ καὶ πορίζεται τὰς ἡδονάς.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Socrates: I was saying, wasn’t I, that I didn’t think that pastry baking is a craft (τέχνη), but a knack (ἐμπειρία), whereas medicine is a craft (τέχνη). I said that the one, medicine, has investigated both the nature (φύσις) of the object it serves and the cause (αἰτία) of the things it does, and is able to give an account (λόγος) of each of these. The other, the one concerned with pleasure, to which the whole of its service is entirely devoted, proceeds toward its object in a quite uncraftlike way (ἀτεχνῶς), without having at all considered either the nature of pleasure or its cause. It does so completely irrationally (ἀλόγως), with virtually no discrimination. Through routine and knack it merely preserves the memory of what customarily happens, and that’s how it also supplies its pleasures.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:50&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:50&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can distinguish in this passage three Socratic objections to the notion of a τέχνη based strictly on experience. The first is that mere experience is insufficient for attaining the reliability characteristic of the expert: hence Socrates’ claim that pastry making “merely preserves the memory of what customarily happens,” and proceeds “with virtually no discrimination,” whereas the doctor knows why he does the things he does—which I take to mean that the doctor does &lt;em&gt;each&lt;/em&gt; of the things he does with attention to any relevant peculiarities of given circumstances.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:51&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:51&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;51&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second objection is that even insofar as the merely experienced practitioner may be reliable, his efforts will be misdirected. The contrast between τέχνη and ἐμπειρία is treated in this passage as a contrast not only between understanding and guess-work, but as a contrast between aiming at the good and aiming at pleasure. The pastry chef is a doctor without real understanding: like the doctor, he is concerned with the body, but his guide is not what is good for the body but only what feels good for it. That is all he can aim at, because he doesn’t really know what health is; medicine, by contrast, “has investigated both the nature of the object it serves and the cause of the things it does.” For this point it is not necessary to suppose that the pastry chef is no good at what he does—indeed we are well-advised to be wary of just how convincing he can be. Earlier on, Socrates had acknowledged that the orator may be more persuasive concerning medicine even than a doctor, at least among the ignorant, though of course he “isn’t knowledgeable in the thing in which a doctor is knowledgeable” (459b). That the orator may achieve that kind of success does not count in favour of his claim to possession of a τέχνη, and Socrates asks whether&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;τυγχάνει περὶ τὸ δίκαιον καὶ τὸ ἄδικον καὶ τὸ αἰσχρὸν καὶ τὸ καλὸν καὶ ἀγαθὸν καὶ κακὸν οὕτως ἔχων ὁ ῥητορικὸς ὡς περὶ τὸ ὑγιεινὸν καὶ περὶ τὰ ἄλλα ὧν αἱ ἄλλαι τέχναι;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;the orator is in the same position with respect to what’s just and unjust, what’s shameful and admirable, what’s good and bad, as he is about what’s healthy and about the subjects of the other crafts? (459d)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The doctor, by distinction, know know health and whatever else his τέχνη concerns, and a rhetorical τέχνη ought to be similar.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:52&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:52&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;52&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third objection we can distinguish here is that a practice founded only on experience is undeserving of the title of ‘τέχνη.’ We can see that this would be an objection even granting that the object of the practice were legitimate and that it reliably achieved success from the fact that pastry baking “proceeds toward its object in a quite uncraftlike way, without having at all considered either the nature of pleasure or its cause”—in other words, pastry baking doesn’t investigate even its own already degenerate object in the manner proper to τέχνη. To sum things up, I take Socrates’ point to be that if you don’t understand the nature of your aims and of your subject matter, then you’re in no position to know what would be the “good condition” of the things you treat.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:53&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:53&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;53&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Thus you cannot aim at that good condition but only, and only by guesswork, at what will please some person at some time. We might contrast an idealized cobbler, who knows the support a foot needs and how to provide it, with a shoe designer, who is concerned with aesthetic pleasure rather than comfort or health. The cobbler’s principles are always the same; the trends are changing and unpredictable.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:54&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:54&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;54&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is doubtful whether we ought to attribute a peculiar and disputable view of τέχνη to the &lt;em&gt;Gorgias&lt;/em&gt;’ Polus;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:55&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:55&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;55&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Aristotle mentions his statement as if it were a truism.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:56&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:56&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;56&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But something like the disagreement between Polus and Socrates created, in later centuries, a schism between medical empiricists and medical rationalists; Galen says that “medicine is the science (ἐπιστήμη) of what is healthy and what is unhealthy,” but that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;whence one may come by the knowledge of these is no longer universally agreed upon. Some say that experience (ἐμπειρία) alone suffice for the art ([ἡ ἰατρικὴ] τέχνη), whereas others think that reason (λόγος), too, has an important contribution to make.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:57&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:57&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;57&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our purposes we may forgo the details of this disagreement, noting only that the empiricists claimed that the kind of theoretical understanding insisted upon by the rationalists was, if not impossible, then useless, or at any rate superfluous to the practice of medicine; the possibility or possession of such understanding was irrelevant to the possibility of successful medical practice.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:58&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:58&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;58&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; And the rationalists for their part developed Socratic objections:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Some have said that this kind of experience is unrealizable (ἀσύστατος), and others, that it is incomplete (ἀτελής), while a third group has claimed that it is not technical (ἄτεχνος).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:59&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:59&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;59&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A related Socratic point that emerges in several dialogues is the idea that that every genuine τέχνη must have a domain or subject matter (or πρᾶγμα) with a certain natural integrity.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:60&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:60&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;60&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In the &lt;em&gt;Laches&lt;/em&gt; the proposal that courage might be knowledge of future goods and evils is rejected on the grounds that there is no such thing as knowledge concerned with farming &lt;em&gt;in the future&lt;/em&gt; in particular, or with health or strategy &lt;em&gt;in the future.&lt;/em&gt; The topic will just be health &lt;em&gt;period&lt;/em&gt;, or strategy, or farming, or goods and evils generally (198d–199d). Similarly Ion is taken to task for the suggestion that he knows and can interpret only the works of Homer, but that as far as other poets go he “has no power to contribute anything worthwhile” (&lt;em&gt;Ion&lt;/em&gt; 532b–c). One learns, or should learn, “a subject as a whole” (532e); i.e. poetry, or sculpture, not specific poets or sculptors. Moreover, knowing a subject entails being able to explain the principles of the τέχνη, to teach the τέχνη, and to act as an arbiter on questions about the domain governed by the τέχνη (eg. &lt;em&gt;Gorgias&lt;/em&gt; 450). And these capacities come as a package, it seems: even to claim be able to “speak well” on a given topic is &lt;em&gt;thereby,&lt;/em&gt; in Socrates’ view, to claim craft knowledge in that domain. Thus Ion fails not only on generality but also, like Homer, gets his fingers into too many pies. He claims to speak authoritatively on sailing and racing and military affairs and so on (all the subjects Homer addresses), but of course nobody could really be expert in all of these things at once. So here we find that Socrates has a rather more demanding understanding of τέχνη than Ion would have (not that Ion will have considered the matter carefully before), and hence disagrees about whether certain facilities ought to be considered τέχναι. Instead, Socrates says that Ion is possessed by a sort of divine madness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;iiii-the-distinctiveness-of-socratic-&quot;&gt;II.ii The distinctiveness of Socratic τέχνη&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the course of the forgoing discussion we saw Socrates articulate and defend several criteria for τέχνη. [BRIEF RECAP] As such it is clear that Socrates has a considered (though nowhere systematically articulated) conception of τέχνη, and one which is, moreover, clearly at odds with various other conceptions of τέχνη. So, for example, Socrates himself expressly contrasts his own conception of τέχνη with Polus’ supposedly deficient conception; likewise he would have had no truck with medical empiricism. Again, Socrates’ conception of τέχνη leads him to various specific judgements about which practices are and are not τέχναι—he views medicine as a genuine τέχνη, but raises doubts about the status of poetry, ‘cookery,’ and rhetoric—sometimes putting him at odds with his interlocutors. I will conclude this section by demonstrating briefly that, in particular, Socrates’ conception of τέχνη differs from Aristotle’s, and from what we find in Plato’s other, later dialogues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their different expectations for the precision and reliability of τέχνη, we have a clear contrast between Socrates and Aristotle. Aristotle’s insistence that a high degree of precision and hence of reliability could not be demanded of every legitimate τέχνη was (more or less) original to him. Where Aristotle is at pains to argue that moral inquiry is legitimate although imprecise, Socrates is happy to invoke the marks of mathematical precision in his investigation of the virtues, for example at 356d–e, where he invokes a hypothetical “craft of measurement” as our “salvation” (see further §III below). Socrates’ expectations for the reliability of  are comparable to those in &lt;em&gt;De Arte&lt;/em&gt;, or even to the view in &lt;em&gt;On Regimen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:61&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:61&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;61&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Socrates allows, of course, that any given person might fail in the employment of their τέχνη—for example at &lt;em&gt;Euthydemus&lt;/em&gt; 279e–280a, where he contrasts wise and foolish doctors or generals. It is not clear that Socrates regognizes any further limitations on τέχνη. In &lt;em&gt;Republic&lt;/em&gt; I, Thrasymachus says that experts, insofar as they are experts, never make mistakes (340e), and Socrates accepts this assumption (342b). The context is the question whether a ruler will ever mistakenly issue laws which in fact turn out to be detrimental to himself, so the point in saying that experts never make mistakes seems to be that, if that the expert properly employs his τέχνη, he will never fail to attain his intended goal (within the domain of that τέχνη; 340e). Here, as in &lt;em&gt;De Arte&lt;/em&gt; and as with Glaucon’s view in II, the possibility of sheer misfortune is rejected.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:62&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:62&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;62&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In the &lt;em&gt;Euthydemus&lt;/em&gt;, Socrates, adducing a variety of τέχναι, deploys the notion that τέχνη is a guard against bad τύχη (279d ff.), finally going so far as to say that σοφία (here synonymous with τέχνη) &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; (good) τύχη (279d), or at any rate provides it (282a). Here, then, Socrates himself deliberately pushes luck out of the picture.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:63&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:63&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;63&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; At &lt;em&gt;Euthydemus&lt;/em&gt; 280a, ‘being lucky’ is glossed as ‘never making mistakes;’&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:64&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:64&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;64&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; this latter characterization of τέχνη is also found at &lt;em&gt;Protagoras&lt;/em&gt; 357d–e, and the notion that τέχνη is infallible at least within the realm of τύχη certainly accords with the salvific conception of a τέχνη for living found in that passage (356d–e).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:65&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:65&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;65&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is little or no space between Socrates and Plato (between the earlier and the middle to later dialogues, that is) on the question of precision and reliability, except that Plato at least more expressly acknowledges the kind of principled limits on τέχνη-success identified by the author of &lt;em&gt;De Arte&lt;/em&gt;. There are other significant differences, though. Chief among these is the fact that Plato has a more developed view of the structure of τέχνη-possesion. We can see this especially in the evolving relationship between ‘τέχνη’ and ‘ἐπιστήμη.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In later dialogues, as in the earlier, ‘τέχνη’ and ‘ἐπιστήμη’ are often interchangeable. So, for example, early in the &lt;em&gt;Theaetetus&lt;/em&gt;, Socrates says that the τέχνη of cobbling just is the ἐπιστήμη of making shoes (146c–d). In other cases, though, ἐπιστήμη begins to take on a life of its own—not necessarily as something altogether independent of τέχνη, but as something with a distinct role. In the &lt;em&gt;Phaedrus&lt;/em&gt;, for example, ‘ἐπιστήμη’ occurs nine times but is never equivalent to ‘τέχνη,’ though the two are related. When Phaedrus asks Socrates how someone might acquire the τέχνη of the true and persuasive rhetorician, Socrates answers thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;τὸ μὲν δύνασθαι, ὦ Φαῖδρε, ὥστε ἀγωνιστὴν τέλεον γενέσθαι, εἰκός—ἴσως δὲ καὶ ἀναγκαῖον—ἔχειν ὥσπερ τἆλλα: εἰ μέν σοι ὑπάρχει φύσει ῥητορικῷ εἶναι, ἔσῃ ῥήτωρ ἐλλόγιμος, προσλαβὼν ἐπιστήμην τε καὶ μελέτην, ὅτου δ᾽ ἂν ἐλλείπῃς τούτων, ταύτῃ ἀτελὴς ἔσῃ.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Well, Phaedrus, becoming good enough to be an accomplished competitor is probably—perhaps necessarily—like everything else. If you have a natural ability for rhetoric (φύσις ῥητορική), you will become a famous rhetorician, provided you supplement your ability with knowledge (ἐπιστήμη) and practice (μελέτη). To the extent that you lack any one of them, to that extent you will be less than perfect.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:66&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:66&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;66&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following pages make it clear that the ἐπιστήμη in question is an understanding of the soul, its varieties, and the effects different sorts of speeches have on different souls (which the orator will need to augment with experience so as to discern reliably how to apply this knowledge; 271–272). Here, then, ἐπιστήμη is an aspect of τέχνη, or the intellectual aspect of τέχνη-possession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Republic&lt;/em&gt;, too, ‘ἐπιστήμη’ and ‘τέχνη’ are sometimes equivalent&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:67&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:67&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;67&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but, as in the &lt;em&gt;Phaedrus&lt;/em&gt;, ‘ἐπιστήμη’ may also have the more restricted sense of the knowledge which is one component of the complete or ideal possession of a craft. So at 374d Socrates observes that “no … tool makes anyone who picks it up a craftsman (δημιουργός) or champion unless he had acquired the requisite knowledge (ἐπιστήμη) and has had sufficient experience (μελέτη).” Indeed this passage (374b–e) draws attention to the same three aspects of expertise identified in the &lt;em&gt;Phaedrus&lt;/em&gt;—a suitable nature (φύσις), knowledge (ἐπιστήμη), and practice (μελέτη)—though not so sharply or emphatically as in the other work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in the &lt;em&gt;Republic&lt;/em&gt;, ἐπιστήμη also seems to have its own independent existence. Thus ‘ἐπιστήμη’ is not always used just as a word for an aspect of τέχνη or as offering an alternative way of characterizing a τέχνη (i.e. as the “ἐπιστήμη of …”), but as a name for more abstract forms of knowledge or expertise. Thus ‘ἐπιστήμη’ is apt particularly for arithmetical, geometrical, and astronomical knowledge, the last being understood not primarily as dealing with the actual movements of heavenly bodies but with motion proper (529d–e). These are forms of knowledge which deal with what really is, and which lead the mind away from what is visible and tangible (524e ff.). And [dialectic], or the knowledge it provides, is even more properly called ‘ἐπιστήμη’ (533d). We might then suppose that in one sense of ‘ἐπιστήμη,’ ‘ἐπιστήμη’ is a name for a type of body of knowledge distinct from the type of body of knowledge constituted by τέχναι. On the other hand, if we can here draw a distinction between τέχνη and ἐπιστήμη, we could equally well call it a distinction between different sorts of τέχναι: on the one hand more directly practical τέχναι, and on the other hand more theoretical τέχναι. For although arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and dialectic are largely treated under the label of ‘ἐπιστήμη,’ they can equally well be called τέχναι (532b, 533d). It’s reasonable as well to see a connection between the role of ἐπιστήμη as the intellectual aspect of τέχνη and the fact that more cognitive τέχναι most properly receive the title of ‘ἐπιστήμη.’ When Socrates is introducing “number and calculation” (ἀριθμός καὶ λογισμός; 522c) as subjects which will lead the soul “from the realm of becoming to the realm of what is” (521d), he introduces them also as subjects that are common to “every craft (τέχνη), every type of thought (διάνοια), and every science (ἐπιστήμη)” (522b–c). The general, for instance, needs to be able to count his troops and ships and to arrange them (522c–e). But of course arithmetic is also a type of study in its own right. Arithmetic could therefore be said to be ἐπιστήμη both in the sense that it forms (a part of) the theoretical aspect of various other τέχναι, and also in the sense that it is itself ἐπιστήμη, which is to say a relatively abstract τέχνη. Geometry, astronomy, and dialectic, introduced in the following pages, are perhaps increasingly less implicated in other crafts, and increasingly constitute strictly abstract studies in their own right. At least in the case of arithmetic, it’s hardly necessary to distinguish the two respects in which it is ἐπιστήμη. But in the other cases as well, it seems natural enough that where ἐπιστήμη has come to stand for the more cognitive aspects of τέχνη, more cognitive τέχναι should also come to be called ἐπιστῆμαι.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the earlier dialogues, Socrates occasionally acknowledged, in casual remarks, the importance of aptitude and experience, but there was little or no reflective attention to these aspects of τέχνη. Plato winds up paying much more attention to them, and his views about τέχνη and knowledge evolve accordingly; eventually, even if Plato does not draw quite the sort of distinctions between forms of knowledge that Aristotle does, he certainly winds up with some fairly sharp gradations—more theoretical varieties of knowledge, now especially called ‘ἐπιστῆμαι,’ are up top, and more practical forms, still well described as ‘τέχναι,’ are lower down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;iii-texnh-and-propositional-knowledge&quot;&gt;III. Texnh and Propositional Knowledge&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;iiii-as-a-source-of-knowledge&quot;&gt;III.i τέχνη as a source of knowledge&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Οἱ πολλοί, according to Socrates, believe that one can know what one should do, and yet not do it: they believe that knowledge () is weak, and that we are often governed by other things instead—“sometimes anger, sometimes pleasure, sometimes pain, on occasion love, often fear.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:68&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:68&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;68&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Socrates and Protagoras disagree with the many; they think that knowledge is a “strong” (ἰσχυρός) and governing (ἡγεμονικός, ἀρχικός) thing. The explicit and important discussion of knowledge which follows is therefore prompted by a worry which seems to be, at least in the first place, about the significance of knowing what one ought to do on a given occasion—i.e. it seems to concern something like propositional knowledge rather than . But, on examination, the discussion reflects the idea that what a person knows about some particular situation may reflect the employment of some relevant expertise—for example, I may not know whether the discolouration on my arm is melanoma, but the doctor will, because he is a doctor. The discussion will therefore be useful as an illustration of the often significant interest that Socrates takes in knowledge which does not constitute a , but nevertheless depends upon and manifests a .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Socrates begins by attributing to his opponents the view that the best action is the most pleasant action, or the action most productive of pleasure over time—i.e. hedonism. From this view it follows that for pleasure to overwhelm you is for some &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; to overwhelm you. And this good which “overwhelms” you must not be the greater good, or you would not be doing anything wrong by pursuing it. So being overwhelmed must entail choosing lesser goods over greater. But this is unintelligible, since there is no longer a question of being deceived by pleasures and pains distinct from the goods and evils in question (255d–e).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:69&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:69&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;69&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looked at from the other direction, being overwhelmed would, again by hedonism, have to mean choosing lesser pleasures over greater. But, says Socrates, there is nothing more to comparing the values of two sets of pleasures and pains than weighing them up against each other, and weighing is treated as a purely quantitative matter (256a). So now again, Socrates thinks, there is nothing here to be overwhelmed by: it is not intelligible that a person would choose a set of pleasures which they see to be the smaller. The language of ‘outweighing’ is, Socrates thinks, quite apt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weighing is a good analogy; you put the pleasures together and the pains together, both the near and the remote, on the balance scale, and then say which of the two is more. For if you weigh pleasant things against pleasant, the greater and the more must always be taken; if painful things against painful, the fewer and the smaller. (356b)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reasons discussed in §[distinct], this language also indicates to Socrates that our “salvation” will be a “craft of measurement,” which would&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;render the appearance ineffective: by making clear the truth, it would cause the soul to be at peace by abiding in the truth, and so save our life. (356d–e)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this completes the argument: to know what to do is, in fact, to possess a suitable which  will ensure a clear view of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our purposes, it is useful to think of the argument as having two stages (not actually distinct in the text). First, Socrates rejects the possibility of ‘akrasia’ on the typical contemporary understanding thereof, as acting otherwise than as you believe best; second, Socrates argues that  are decisive as regards belief formation.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:70&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:70&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;70&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The first stage alone would not be of great interest to Socrates because, in his view, merely believing that some course of action is best is largely worthless from the perspective of producing that action. The “power of appearances,” we are told, causes us “to wander and to change back and forth, to accept and reject the same things in actions and in choices of large and small” (i.e. large and small pleasures).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:71&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:71&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;71&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; So we do what we believe best—but we are easily misled, and we easily change our minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beliefs are only of value insofar as they reflect wisdom or . In the &lt;em&gt;Crito&lt;/em&gt; Socrates tells the eponymous character that we should be attentive to the beliefs of wise people rather than to those of foolish people (46d–47b); it is also a point of the that it is to the knowledgeable that things will appear as they are. The point is not that wisdom consists in having the right views but that some people may be expected to have the right views because they are wise. This is just the point Socrates goes on to make in the &lt;em&gt;Protagoras&lt;/em&gt;. Beliefs have many sources besides one’s own expertise: wishful thinking, sadness or anger, nearby pleasures or faraway pains, optical illusions, the advice of experts or of charlatans. These forces sometimes compete, and some are stronger than others. So, in the speeches of Phaedrus and Agathon in the &lt;em&gt;Symposium,&lt;/em&gt; love dominates other emotions: fear would not drive you from battle while you fight beside your beloved. Likewise, in the &lt;em&gt;Gorgias&lt;/em&gt;, Socrates concedes that the testimony of the orator, who knows how to play on the emotions, will, among the ignorant, be more compelling than the testimony of a genuine expert.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:72&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:72&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;72&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But, according to Socrates, knowledge (if you possess it yourself) dominates all other sources of belief. That is what he means by saying that knowledge is &lt;em&gt;strong,&lt;/em&gt; as he puts it in the &lt;em&gt;Protagoras&lt;/em&gt; (352b): without a τέχνη, your beliefs are at the mercy of other forces; if you possess a τέχνη, you will think the right way about the appropriate cases.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:73&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:73&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;73&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Crito&lt;/em&gt; Socrates calls the views that stem from expertise “good beliefs,” but sometimes he simply calls such views &lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt;, just as the many talked of knowledge of particular facts in the &lt;em&gt;Protagoras.&lt;/em&gt; Thus we have 537c–e, where Socrates is indeed explicit about this relationship between  and knowlede about particular facts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take these fingers: I know () there are five of them, and you know () the same thing about them that I do. Now suppose I ask you whether it’s the same craft ()—that of arithmetic—that teaches you and me (by which we know: ) the same things, or whether it’s two different ones. Of course you’d say it’s the same one.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:74&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:74&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;74&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And likewise the charioteer will be the one to judge advice on racing, and so also the doctor and the pilot in their respective spheres (537). We therefore find that in different senses τέχνη &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; knowledge and &lt;em&gt;is a source of&lt;/em&gt; knowledge.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:75&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:75&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;75&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This must not, of course, be allowed to obscure the priority of  over other forms of knowledge (a priority indicated in the case of the  by the very existence of the second stage of the argument).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:76&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:76&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;76&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;knowledge-as-a-source-of-&quot;&gt;Knowledge as a source of ?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is natural to suppose that while propositional knowledge will sometimes be an expression of expertise, propositional knowledge may also play a constitutive role—perhaps a foundational role—in expertise. For example, while the doctor’s knowledge that my skin discolouration is melanoma is not properly a part of his medical knowledge (if my case is routine he will not have learned anything new, medically speaking), presumably his knowledge that melanoma may often be distinguished from moles by coloration a constituent of his medical knowledge, and probably something he had to know long before he had actually earned the title of ‘doctor.’ On some views, expertise is to be understood (at least partly) in terms of the accumulation of such information. According to Alvin Goldman,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;an expert … is someone who possesses an extensive fund of knowledge (true belief) and a set of skills or methods for apt and successful deployment of this knowledge to new questions in the domain.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:77&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:77&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;77&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this view, expertise is something that can indeed be deployed to gain new (belief-constituted) knowledge, but is also itself to be understood in terms of knowledge constituted by true beliefs, coupled with “skills or techniques” or “know-how.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:78&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:78&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;78&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Should we attribute some such view to Socrates?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A difficulty in trying to identify a determinate Socratic answer to the question whether or how propositional knowledge might play a constituent role within  is that (as is one of the theses of this paper) Socrates does not—at least not explicitly—draw any distinctions whatever between different forms of knowledge, let alone our distinctions.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:79&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:79&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;79&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But here is what Angela Smith says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Socrates] is investigating the conditions under which one can be said to know a subject, the conditions under which one can be said to be an expert in a field. Knowledge of this sort will turn out to involve a complex combination of knowledge of propositions, knowledge of skills, and knowledge of things, though the differences among these three kinds of knowledge are never emphasized.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:80&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:80&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;80&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would suppose that Smith has in mind such passage as this one from the , where ‘telling’ might suggest propositional knowledge to us, ‘looking’ acquaintance, and ‘using’ knowledge-how, and the three are all bundled together:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Socrates: Tell me then what this form [of piety] itself is, so that I may look upon it, and using it as a model, say that any action of yours or another’s that is of that kind is pious, and if it is not that it is not.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:81&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:81&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;81&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should be careful to observe, though, that such passages don’t tell us anything interesting about Socrates’ own view of the philosophical terrain. (We would not attribute a to someone a three-way distinction between forms of knowledge simply on account of having heard them say something like: “You know this John fellow I’ve heard about? Tell me what he looks like so I’ll recognize him if I see him.”) They certainly don’t constitute explicit statements of epistemological doctrine. That Socratic  a involves “a complex combination of knowledge of propositions, knowledge of skills, and knowledge of things” must be our thought, and our analysis, not his.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:82&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:82&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;82&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, there is some reason to say that, insofar as Socratic expertise might be, in some manner or to some degree, constituted by beliefs, those beliefs do not constitute instances of actual knowledge in their own right unless and until they are held by someone who possess the  properly speaking. To see this, let us first look forward to the , where something very near our present question is explicitly addressed. Socrates there indicates that belief on its own, whether true or false, is unstable and flighty (97c–98b). But he also says that beliefs become knowledge when tied down with “an account of the reason why” (αἰτίας λογισμός).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:83&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:83&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;83&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I take it that the earlier conversation between Socrates and the slave is mean to illustrate some part of this ‘tying down’ process: there the two had gone through a demonstration to the effect that, taking one square, a second square of twice the area can be constructed by taking the diagonal of the first as a side of the second.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:84&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:84&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;84&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Afterwards, Socrates had said, not that the slave now knows that this can be done, but rather that “these opinions have now just been stirred up like a dream, but if he were repeatedly asked these same questions in various ways, you know that in the end his knowledge about these things would be as accurate as anyone’s” (85c-d). All this suggests that transition from belief to knowledge essentially requires the kind of understanding or facility that attends an increasing mastery of some domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that the earlier dialogues manifest the analogous view of the relationship between belief and . In the  passage considered just above, there was an explicit contrast between the security and stability of  and the instability of belief, and these are common themes in the earlier dialogues.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:85&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:85&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;85&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; And in the passage discussed in §[distinct] above, we say Socrates contrasted real  with the kind of facility that “merely preserves the memory of what customarily happens” (501a). Now we might suppose that memorizing a lot of information about how things tend to work is at least laying the groundwork for mastery of the field, but Socrates himself is quite dismissive. Thus while there is no explicit theory in the early dialogues about what, if any, constitutive role beliefs or propositional knowledge might play for , we do find a consistent and sometimes explicit contrast between, on the one hand, possessing beliefs, which we are liable to change because we don’t have any real understanding, and, on the other hand, possession of a . It would seem, then, that we can attribute propositional knowledge to experts, but only to experts.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:86&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:86&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;86&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the proposed view a bit more intelligible, notice that we need not suppose that Socrates imagines some sharp and sudden transition from mere guessing to full-blown expertise—Socrates need only think that knowledge even of particular facts can be attributed only insofar as we can also attribute some more general understanding. In fact, although Socrates is dismissive of people to whom we would attribute a great deal of knowledge, something closely approximating this Socratic way of think about knowledge is perfectly familiar. When I first took a course in logic, there was a period during which myself and many of my fellow students could employ conditional and inductive proofs, but didn’t understand why they worked. We could often have claimed certainty about our results: often we could, in one sense, have claimed to know that our results were correct, and to a logical certainty. But at the same time the process was mysterious, and we were sometimes bewildered by the results. As such, one of us would sometimes say, even as we were rigorously establishing a conclusion, “I have no idea what I’m doing.” Or again one of us might say “so that’s the answer?” and receive the reply “I dunno, I guess so.” Our unwillingness to claim knowledge was, moreover, connected with the fact that our lack of understanding entailed a kind of insecurity and instability in our procedures. For example, some trivial novelty of formulation or notation would sometimes cause us uncertainty as to whether induction could still be employed. It is also easy to imagine even our deductive certainty about particular results withering at a frown from our professor. If we had really understood induction and conditional proof, such things could not easily have happened. Often, then, we thought about our relationship to logic in terms of rather Socratic contrast between mere guessing or rote application on the one hand, and genuine understanding and a broader facility on the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-case-of-socratic-definition&quot;&gt;The case of ‘Socratic definition’&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Woodruff, one of relatively few scholars to have emphasized and tried to explicate the role of  in the epistemology of the early dialogues, also gives the knowledge of ‘definitions’ a central role . For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do not know what Virtue is, Socrates asks in the , in what way could you advise someone else as to how that is best acquired? His questions expects Laches’ answer: “none.” The ensuing inquiry presupposes the principle of the : knowing the definition of Courage is necessary to expert knowledge on that subject.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:87&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:87&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;87&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If, as Woodruff says, these definitions “state the essence (οὐσία) of the definiendum,” then we would seem to have prominent Socratic candidates for propositional knowledge which is prior to and constituent of Socratic .&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:88&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:88&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever kind of answer Socrates expects to his familiar “what is X” question, we mistake the purpose of the question if we suppose the desired answer to represent or reflect knowledge that might be prior to anything else. Rather Socrates’ question reflects his belief that the expert can articulate his understanding, and that, as such, he may be interrogated. Angela Smith has pointed out the crucial importance of attending to the context of Socrates’ questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a striking fact that in every dialogue in which Socrates asks a ``What is X?” question, he asks for a definition only his interlocutor has (a) explicitly claimed to be an expert (b), explicitly offered or agreed to teach Socrates or someone else, or (c) accepted (or not denied) an explicit claim to expertise made by another on his behalf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noticing, too, that the claims to expertise, and the invocations of  in particular, are often less obvious to us than they would have the the Greek reader. In the , for example, it is clear enough to the modern reader that Euthyphro purports to possess of special insight into moral matters, but it is easy to overlook the symbolic importance of the invocation of precision (4e–5a) and of the measure-weight-number triad (7b–c); we are still less likely to pick up on the significance of the employment of ‘’ (see §[knowledge] below); in other words, it’s relatively easy not to see that, as far as Socrates is concerned, Euthyphro has claimed to possess a  concerned with piety. Socrates’ familiar question in fact functions first of all as a test of putative experts, or, alternatively, as an expression of his expectation that whatever knowledge is in question ought to constitute a genuine area of expertise.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:89&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:89&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;89&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A definition is just a symbol, a particularly clear manifestation, of the kind of knowledge possessed by an expert.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:90&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:90&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;90&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that case, Socrates’ “what is X” question expresses his interest in specifically expert knowledge, and his expectation that experts be able to express their knowledge in a certain way. It isn’t evidence that he considers there to be some form of knowledge that might be prior to or constitutive of . The answer to his question wouldn’t even constitute the content of the expert’s knowledge—it would simple express it. And that is so whatever exactly a Socratic definition is (Smith, for example, is willing to accept [SANTAS; CITES]). As Smith says, “too much emphasis has been placed upon the formal features of the Socratic elenchus, and not enough on the purpose and spirit of it.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:91&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:91&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;91&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;iv-other-varieties-of-knowledge&quot;&gt;IV. Other Varieties of Knowledge?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the previous section I argued that  is for Socrates a foundational form of knowledge, first in that it cannot be understood in terms of any other kind of knowledge, and second in that we can attribute further knowledge to a person in virtue of their possession of a , whether as a manifestation, exercise, or aspect of it. But that leaves open the possibility that Socrates acknowledges varieties of knowledge which are neither prior nor posterior to , but not equivalent to it either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This much is undeniable: Socrates avows knowledge, and attributes knowledge to others, in cases where there is no relevant , or where the knower is at any rate not possessed of any relevant . So, for example, Charmides knows Greek.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:92&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:92&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;92&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 293b has Socrates knowing “many things but slight things.” “To do injustice and disobey my superior,” Socrates insists in the , “I know to be evil and base” (29b). In the &lt;em&gt;Gorgias&lt;/em&gt; he tells Polus: “I know well that if you will agree with me on those things which my soul believes, those things will be the very truth” (486e). And many other such cases might be adduced.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:93&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:93&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;93&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Socrates’ claims to moral knowledge are often and understandably considered particularly striking, since Socrates also disavows moral knowledge in sweeping terms. Vlastos, for example, was impressed by Socrates claim in the to have that “one who does what’s unjust is always more miserable than the one who suffers it, and the one who avoids paying what’s due always more miserable than the one who does pay it.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:94&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:94&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;94&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Socrates’ confidence cannot be based on any moral , since he is quite explicit that he possesses no such , much as he would like to: in the , for example, Socrates observes that training children is far more important than training horses, and laments the fact that neither he nor anybody else seems to know how to do the former. [A GUIDING ASSUMPTION] &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:95&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:95&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;95&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[IDEA THAT CAN’T KNOW WHERE YOU DON’T HAVE A TECHNE]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my view, Socrates remarks are properly construed as expressing the view that one possess no knowledge in or about a domain unless one possesses the appropriate . But in either case the result is that we have Socrates espousing knowledge in precisely that domain which he says most clearly that does not and cannot be based on assess any knowledge. [MUST WE THEN…?]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—and many other&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:96&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:96&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;96&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;—passages as expressing Hence even if other avowals or knowledge could somehow be subsumed under , that cannot be so for any moral claims Socrates makes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FOOTNOTE: The apparent tension is often understood in terms of the putative Socratic commtment to ‘the priority of definition,’ which is often construed as the view that one cannot know anything about e.g. virtue without knowing what virtue is, and again one cannot know whether something (i.e. some act or object) is e.g. admirable (&lt;em&gt;kalon&lt;/em&gt;) without knowing what the admirable &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:97&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:97&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;97&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Many of the purported Socratic avowals of moral knowledge look suspiciously like truisms or tautologies.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:98&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:98&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;98&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; For the sake of argument, I ignore this fact, but it is not an unimportant point, and it fits well with the general response I offer in this section.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question, then, is whether we ought to say that there are for Socrates any further forms of knowledge—not more or less basic than , but independent of it? And if so, how can this be, given [FINISH].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On some views, taking all of Socrates’ avowals and disavowals of knowledge at face value would quite simply require us to recognize inconsistencies in the early dialogues. Terence Irwin assumes this in suggesting that the positive knowledge claims are anomalous, and that what Socrates really avows (or means to avow) in these cases is not knowledge but merely warranted true belief.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:99&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:99&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;99&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Richard Kraut assumes the same thing, but thinks the inconsistencies are real, and takes their existence to support a developmentalist reading of the early dialogues: so, for example, Kraut thinks that Socrates’ epistemological standards are lower in the and higher in the (later) .&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:100&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:100&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;100&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;In principle, some such strategy, insofar as possessed of any merit, might also be invoked in order to handle putative examples of -independent knowledge. But they seem to me unmotivated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Socrates’ reflective epistemological outlook does not embrace all of the varieties of knowledge he invokes in speech, but it does not follow from this that there is some incoherence in his epistemological outlook. To see why this is, consider the various ways we use knowledge-talk ourselves. Take the following exercise from Jech’s :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;exercise&lt;/span&gt;. Assume that &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;a, r&lt;/span&gt; is a linearly ordered structure with &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; countable and &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; dense. Show that &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;a, r&lt;/span&gt; is isomorphic to &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;b, &amp;lt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;span&gt;-2pt&lt;/span&gt;$\begin{smallmatrix}_{\circ}\ \\text{\textsc{q}}\end{smallmatrix}$&lt;span&gt;-3pt&lt;/span&gt; for some subset &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; of .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And consider now whether I know that, given a linearly ordered structure &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;a, r&lt;/span&gt; where &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; is countable and &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; is dense, it follows that &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;a, r&lt;/span&gt; is isomorphic to &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;b, &amp;lt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;span&gt;-2pt&lt;/span&gt;$\begin{smallmatrix}_{\circ}\ \\text{\textsc{q}}\end{smallmatrix}$&lt;span&gt;-3pt&lt;/span&gt; for some subset &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; of . (For convenience, let us give this conditional proposition the label ‘.’) Well, on the one hand, Jech wouldn’t have set this excercise if it weren’t the case that . In some circumstances, that alone would lead me to claim to know that , even if I had only the vaguest understanding of what actually means. Suppose for example that a friend calls me up and says he is trying to remember whether —in that case I would tell him that indeed I know that , because I just came across it as an assumed result in Jech. On the other hand, if that were all there were to it, then probably I would more typically disavow knowledge. Suppose, for instance, that another friend were to ask whether I know anything about isomorphisms with linearly ordered structures, and that although I’ve just come across assumed as a result in Jech, I’m foggy about what exactly ‘&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;b, &amp;lt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;span&gt;-2pt&lt;/span&gt;$\begin{smallmatrix}_{\circ}\ \\text{\textsc{q}}\end{smallmatrix}$&lt;span&gt;-3pt&lt;/span&gt;’ is supposed to represent—in that case, I certainly would not say “Yes, I know one thing about that, namely that ”; Instead, I would say “No, I don’t know anything about that.” Now only a pedant would refrain from these sorts of natural and expected ways of talking, since we could only confuse by doing so. In that case, the mere fact that I have, in some sense, said or implied both that I do and that I do not know whether , it would be unfair to attribute some incoherence to —after all, I am constrained by the normal use of the English language—and it hardly matters for this point what I think about epistemology as a theoretical matter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That example involves two first-order knowledge claims. With Socrates, however, the conflict is understood to a rise between first-order claims and a second-order claim (or thesis): Socrates avows knowledge about various matters falling within some domain, and also says that he cannot have any knowledge within that domain. But this kind of ‘incompatibility’ needn’t have any significance either. Suppose a friend asks me me: “so, did you know that ?” and that I answer “Nope, I didn’t. I don’t even know what it means for something to be a ‘linearly ordered structure’.” Here I rely on the principle: “I can’t know what I don’t understand.” Nevertheless, I might later avow knowledge that as in the earlier case where a friend was just trying to check a result. So it turns out that I endorse a thesis about knowledge which entails that I cannot know whether , and yet go on to claim to know that . But we are still clearly within the realm of truisms and colloquial English usage, and as such it would confused to suppose that I have betrayed some incoherence by my willingness to say all of the things that I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it has sometimes been thought that near juxtapositions of ‘incompatible’ knowledge claims in the early dialogues are more problematic than other more scattered claims, because they are more noticeable. But this again makes no difference on its own. For example, considering the question just more abstractly, do I in fact know that ? The natural, and indeed correct, answer is: Yes and No. Yes, in that if Jech set it then it can be proved, and, moreover, I once proved myself some years ago. No, in that I don’t remember the exact significance of all of these symbols and concepts anymore, and, even if I did, I would need to spend some time brushing up on set theory generally to have a clear understanding of . This is, again, just the natural way of describing the situation; that someone says such things shows nothing about what if any epistemological views they hold; nor can it sit poorly with any epistemological views, because whatever happens with one’s epistemological theorizing, these will still be natural ways to talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now as philosophers we may be expected to bring some order to our knowledge-talk, and as such we will want to find some way of understanding how various truisms about knowledge fit together, if indeed they do. And there are different ways we might proceed when confronted with examples of the sort I’ve presented. We might, for example, invoke some form of contextualist semantics for knowledge attribution, whereby different standards are established by different conversational settings. Alternatively, we might distinguish different senses of ‘know,’ so that in one sense of ‘know’ I might know that P so long as I have it on good testimony, while in another sense I can know that only if I understand or can explain why it is that . Or, again, we might say that there are different kinds of things I am claiming to know in each case: in the first case I am claiming to know a particular fact, and in the second case denying that I’m familiar with a subject matter. It might even be that we are driven to the conclusion that ordinary knowledge-talk is itself ultimately confused or incoherent. But whatever our view of such matters, we cannot read any such understandings into anyone’s use of the relevant language, .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is, I think, a point that we do not need to be reminded of when reading contemporary philosophy in English. So, for example, I earlier quoted Robert Audi as saying that “knowledge is constituted by belief (of a certain kind).”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:101&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:101&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;101&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Now in a discussion of testimonial knowledge in a companion volume, Audi sketches an example in which he meets a woman on a plane, and “she tells me about a conference in which a speaker I know lost his temper.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:102&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:102&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;102&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Speaking for myself, I feel no temptation to read anything at all into the fact that Audi here speaks of knowing , and I doubt whether any reader of this passage has ever felt that it should be of any particular significance for an understanding of Audi’s epistemological views. And yet although we know that Plato’s style is colloquial, it is routinely assumed that every single Socratic avowal or attribution of knowledge in the early dialogues is relevant to an understanding of the epistemology of those dialogues. On reflection it is clear that the painstaking catalogues of such avowals could not possibly have more than a linguistic interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bearing in mind plausible strategies of these sorts, I do not see any need to be very concerned about supposed inconsistencies in Socrates’ various attributions of, and views about, knowledge. And indeed the issue for most scholars has been not so much to worry that Socrates’ various knowledge claims and ascriptions are contradictory, but to determine &lt;em&gt;what sort of knowledge&lt;/em&gt; Socrates is avowing when he avows knowledge, and &lt;em&gt;what sort of knowledge&lt;/em&gt; he is disavowing when he disavows knowledge.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:103&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:103&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;103&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it would be a mistake to attribute &lt;em&gt;to Socrates himself&lt;/em&gt; a &lt;em&gt;reflective conception&lt;/em&gt; of any form of knowledge besides τέχνη. What there are in the early dialogues are attributions of knowledge which do not fit the τέχνη-conception. But to find in such knowledge-attributions a &lt;em&gt;conception of a form of knowledge&lt;/em&gt; would be to find a Socratic form of knowledge which would have to be “characterized almost entirely in negative terms.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:104&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:104&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;104&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; And contrast with the fairly clear and demanding standards for craft knowledge, Socrates would apparently have &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; particular criteria for any sort of non-expert knowledge.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:105&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:105&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;105&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; At best we might hope to identify some ways Socrates thinks you could come by such knowledge—by divine revelation, perhaps, or as derived from a life’s experience interrogating others.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:106&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:106&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;106&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say “I know X,” and thereby to claim knowledge of some form—with however much confidence or care or sincerity—is not thereby to deploy a conception of that form of knowledge. It does not amount to having a view about that form of knowledge or even to distinguishing it from others. Socrates talks about knowing τέχναι, people, inanimate objects, qualities, and languages, but that is not cause for supposing either that he thinks these all involve the same sort of knowledge or that he has conceptions of five different types of knowledge. Perhaps Socrates &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have distinguished, say, the kind of knowledge a craftsman has from the (propositional, factual) knowledge which the (merely) experienced person has. Later Aristotle did just that (e.g. &lt;em&gt;Metaphysics&lt;/em&gt; 981a28–30). But Socrates only spoke a language for which such distinctions &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be drawn.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:107&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:107&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;107&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may decide that the Socratic conception of knowledge is defective in some way, or that it covers only a limited range of the epistemological phenomena, and we may even think that some of his own claims to knowledge show this. We could say that his attributions of knowledge are actually incoherent, or we could defend the coherence of his attributions by invoking a contextualist semantics. But my topic is Socrates’ &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; conception or conceptions of knowledge. And as far as I can see, the only variety of knowledge of which he has any conception is τέχνη.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[HAVEN’T ADRESSED EVERY POSSIBLE CASE, OF COURSE Can’t of course go through everything, but take for example: Euthydemus 293b has socrates knowing “many things but slight things” so I don’t want to say that there’s any definite regimentation in terms ofprop-K produced by power-K as I guess Benson would say - just that K secures doxastic outlook generally as per Crito ]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[BUT LET’S GIVE A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF TENDENCY TO READ TO MUCH INTO THE TEXT]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIRST: ARTIFICIAL DISTINCTIONS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless he think that despite Socrates’ lack of both expertise and definitional knowledge, Socrates mode of inquiry “depends on knowledge;” knowledge of, for example, courage in the case of the :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for example, David Woodruff, having claimed that definitional knowledge is prior to expertise (quoted above) proceeds thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Socrates’ inquiry depends on knowledge about the nature of Courage. Unless his procedure is sharply out of tune with itself, the knowledge he uses must differ from the knowledge he cannot claim until after successfully defining Courage. The uses a distinction between expert and non-expert knowledge that supports a defense of Socrates’ inquiry. His arguments in the make use only of non-expert knowledge.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:108&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:108&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;108&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is the idea he goes on to explore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smith seems on the whole to think that Socrates’ conception of expertise constitutes his conception of knowledge. So for example she says that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be a mistake… to think that the Socratic conception of knowledge will look anything like modern epistemological theories: Socrates is talking about the conditions of expertise, not about the conditions of factual knowledge .&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:109&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:109&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;109&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And later she observes that “Socrates never shows much interest in the knowledge of single propositions.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:110&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:110&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;110&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But her intended conclusion seems to be the more modest one that Socrates is or concerned with which he would consider to be of significance: so for example she she writes that “Socrates would not have considered it a great epistemic achievement to possess a pocketful of truths unconnected to systematic knowledge.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:111&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:111&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;111&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; And Smith tells us she agrees with Woodruff (and others) regarding the presuppositions of Socratic inquiry: “the relevant distinction is not between certain knowledge and elenctic knowledge [as on Vlastos’ view], but between expert knowledge and non-expert knowledge.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:112&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:112&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;112&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; [AND WHAT ABOUT PARRY?]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIRST: TOO MUCH ABSTRACTION IN GENERAL&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see a lot of slippery language…. eg Woodruff&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recall for instance Woodruff’s motivation for []: “Socrates’ inquiry depends on knowledge about the nature of Courage,” and so, to avoid incoherence, “the knowledge he uses must differ from the knowledge he cannot claim until after successfully defining Courage.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If ‘uses’ means ‘draws’ or ‘reflectively employs’ two different conceptions of knowledge, then there seems to be little basis for the claim. In pariticular, what does the second (non-expert) variety of knowledge look like? Woodruff himself observes that Socrates seems to have no criteria whatever here.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:113&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:113&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;113&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; [ALSO NOTE ARBITRARINESS—WHY ONLY ONE, EG?] If what is meant by ‘uses a distinction’ is rather that Socrates relies upon, or invokes, or deploys, some conception or conceptions of knowledge (or some sense or sense of the relevant Greek words) that doesn’t entail or involve the  model, then the claim is true, but of no significance for understanding the epistemology of the early dialogues: it is likely enough that every language user and every work of literature of any bulk and employing colloquial language will ‘use’ distinctions between different forms of knowledge (including of expert and non-expert varietes) in this fashion. The colloquial [etc]; nor can the employment of such language [obviously matter; we can decide—if W wants to say *that*, then fine.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[DISTINGUISH: S HAS CONCEPTIONS OF TWO VARIETIES OF K, AND S HAS TECHNE PLUS NOT TECHNE—ADRESS THAT second question IN NEXT SECTION]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CONSTRAINTS AND SUCH&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider for example Socrates occasional instruction to his interlocutors to tell him what they really think [CITES]. Vlastos has described this as a [VLASTOS]. Hugh Benson argues that in fact Socrates accepts the ‘doxastic constraint’:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[DC] Being believed by the interlocutor is a necessary and sufficient condition for being a premise of a Socratic elenchos.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:114&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:114&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;114&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between this and Vlastos’ say-what-you-believe ‘constraint’ is the addition of ‘sufficient.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now imagine the following conversation with a doctor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: So, doctor, melonoma is life-threatening, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctor: Sure, I’ll accept that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: …I wasn’t looking for agreement—I wasn’t basing that on anything. I wanted view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctor: Yeah, I guess melonoma seems like it might be life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: It like it? Look, is it or isn’t?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving to a higher level of abstraction, we could say that, in at lenversational settings, I impose the following ‘doxastic requirement’: the interlocutors sincere assertion of some thesis is both necessary and sufficient in order for us to proceed. This is, I suppose, true, but entirely trivial; it reflects nothing peculiar to my conception of knowledge (anyone would have acted as I did), and indicates nothing about what if any considered views I might possess about knowledge—my response would have been equally natural from an epistemologist (regardless of his epistemological theories) or from someone who had never heard of the subject. To say that I accept the ‘doxastic requirement’ for some conversational settings would, moreover, entirely misconstrue the matter: to attribute it to me is to show that you don’t u [[]] [he only proper way to express ]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[point being not innocent—people are assuming that because abstraction is safe, it’s innocent, and it’s not.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DEFINITION STUFF ESPECIALLY&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Santas, for example, says that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the definiendum of a Socratic definition of F-ness or the F is probably an attribute, which (a) is one and the same in all things that are F, (b) is that by reason of which all F things are F, (c) is that by which all F things do not differ but are all the same, and (d) is that which in all F things we call ‘F-ness’ or ‘the F’.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:115&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:115&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;115&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terence Penner rejects the view that Socrates is interested in definitional knowledge, or indeed any kind of propositional knowledge at all:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One needs to know what the reference of courage is. Frege says about reference: “Comprehensive knowledge of the reference would require us to be able to say immediately whether any given sense belongs to it. To such knowledge we never attain.” 80 That is the kind of knowledge of virtue, knowledge, power, desire, good, and so forth that I see Socrates striving for.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:116&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:116&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;116&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angela Smith, while insisting on the preeminence of , thinks that “&lt;span&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;telling us what X is’&lt;span&gt;”&lt;/span&gt; turns out to be a rather complicated affair, much more complicated than merely defining the meaning of a word or expression.” She adduces Santas’ criteria as an artciulation of this complexity, and observes that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are very demanding criteria—so demanding, in fact, that one might begin to wonder how knowledge can ever be gained, if a definition of this sort is a necessary first step to its achievement. As we look at these criteria more carefully, it becomes quite clear that only someone with a sophisticated understanding of X could even begin to try to tackle this Socratic request. Indeed, I think it would be fair to say that only someone who had already achieved expertise could have the breadth of knowledge and experience necessary to produce a definition of this sort. This is a demand, in short, that only an expert, reflecting on the nature of his knowledge, could ever hope to fulfill. A Socratic definition is not the starting point of knowledge; it is, rather, the culmination of it.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:117&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:117&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;117&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Smith herself points out, [SEEMS NOT FITTING FOR OTHER CASE]. Considered in that light, it is unsurprising that WOodruff simply carves Socrates’ desired moral  apart from other : [QUOTE, CITE]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth dwelling on the resulting interpretative situation. There is widespread agreement amongst that Socrates accepts a set of criteria (which are not explicitly formulated) for definition (a notion for which there is no Socratic term—still less for ‘reference’);&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:118&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:118&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;118&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; criteria which are hard even to make intelligible when applied to his own preferred examples of standard  (the very  Socrates invoking precisely to motivate these criteria), if they don’t simply fall short of it (despite their constant employment as paradigms of knowledge). This&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[ought to give pause]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[REMINDER ABOUT SANTAS AND SMITH, OR SHIFT HERE]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this cannot be right. Consider Socrates’ instructions to Euthyphro:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Socrates: Bear in mind then that I did not bid you tell me one or two of the many pious actions but that form itself that makes all pious actions pious, for you agreed that all impious actions are impious and all pious actions pious through one form, or don’t you remember?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Euthyphro: I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Socrates: Tell me then what this form itself is, so that I may look upon it, and using it as a model, say that any action of yours or another’s that is of that kind is pious, and if it is not that it is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This passage, as much as any other, is responsible for the impression that Socrates’ demand is a very stringent one. But that is not a tenable view when we consider the lines which immediately follow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Euthyphro: If that is how you want it, Socrates, that is how I will tell you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Socrates: That is what I want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Euthyphro: Well then, what is dear to the gods is pious, what is not is impious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Socrates: Splendid, Euthyphro! You have now answered in the way I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turns, out the answer is not acceptable. But Socrates thinks it is at least superficially a candidate for being the right answer. But it is clear&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if it were true that Socrates were after an answer that only a true expert could hope to give, he could not possibly think that Euthyphro may just have given such a thing. [] To all appearances, Socrates says what he does about looking upon the form of piety because Euthyphro has been giving him a list of piosu actions, Socrates wants something more general, and the suggestion that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact Socrates is pleased because ….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[IN NEXT SECTION? OR TO BUTRESS PRESENT POINT?]The interest in definitions should not be construed as an interest in knowledge which may be captured by a verbal formula.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:119&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:119&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;119&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Knowledge of a given entity or quality, in the sense Socrates is concerned with, already indicates mastery of the whole rational practice that constitutes a τέχνη.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:120&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:120&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;120&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Socrates’ interest in &lt;em&gt;what things are&lt;/em&gt; has been described as an interest in real as opposed to nominal definitions. This is fair in the sense that Socrates expects experts to be be able to articulate their knowledge. Doctors and laymen alike &lt;em&gt;talk&lt;/em&gt; about health, and can point to examples of healthy people, or give general characterizations of health—as “good condition of the body,” for example. But the layman relies on more superficial signs, and is liable to error, while the doctor can tell healthy people apart from those who merely appear healthy (&lt;em&gt;Gorgias&lt;/em&gt; 464a–b).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:121&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:121&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;121&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The doctor’s ability to give a “real definition” of health is a reflection of this ability to distinguish appearance from reality. So to know what the qualities in question are is, in part, to be able to employ &lt;em&gt;and explain&lt;/em&gt; reliable standards of assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[puzzlement about defs ka as nec and sufficient; puzzle largely disipates on understanding the role]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vlastos, Socrates disavowal of Knowledge, in Fine p. 84: Socrates will never be contradicting himself by saying, or implying, that he both has and hasn’t knowledge, for he will not be saying or implying that he does and doesn’t have knowledgeE, or that he does and doesn’t have knowledgeE, but only that he does have knowledgeE and does not have knowledgeC. Thus his avowal of ignorance will never generate practical inconsistency or doctrinal incoherence. When he tells the interlocutor that he has no knowledge he will not be violating the “say what you believe” rule of elenctic debate, for he will not be feigning ignorance: he does believe with full conviction, with utter sincerity, that he has no knowledgeC.51 Nor will he be endangering his doctrine that “Virtue is knowledge” when this is read, as it should be, “Virtue is knowledgeE”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benson has the ’doxastic contsraint’ at 38 and distinguishes it from Vlastos’ say what you beleive constraint at 39&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gorgias 479e8 cited by Vlastos in 1983b: has it not been proved that what I said before was true? [think of my logic example]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“different working conceptions of knowledge” - only if we mean by this &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; in the sense that knowledge in his mouth can mean different things - and in one important sense there’s only oneworking conception - this is etrayed by tendency to think of all K in terms of craft&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘two’ is arbitrary - again just craft and other - W also on eg 66 taking the other side too seriously - on the other hand 77 plays it down - no criteria etc - a good&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PROBLEMS ARE ALL ENTIRELY DISSOLVED BY SAYING THAT sOCRATES DOESN’T DISTINGUISH CASE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This suggests that whatever Charmides or Euthyphro could &lt;em&gt;say&lt;/em&gt; about temperance or piety would represent only a reflection or aspect of their knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHarm 165: arithmetic is knowledge of the even and the odd etc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;asUSEFUL EXAMPLES FROM PARRY SEP: In some dialogues, craft (technê) and knowledge (epistêmê) seem interchangeable in much the same way as in Xenophon’s Socratic dialogues. In the Charmides (165c) Socrates says that medicine, i.e., the physician’s craft (iatrikê technê), is the knowledge (epistêmê) of health. In Euthydemus (281a) Socrates says that what guides right use of materials in carpentry is the knowledge of carpentry (techtonikê epistêmê). In Ion (532c) Socrates tells the rhapsode Ion that he is not able to talk about Homer with craft and knowledge. In Protagoras (356d-e) Socrates refers to measuring as both a craft and a kind of knowledge&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;iv-knowledge-as-texnh&quot;&gt;IV. Knowledge as Texnh&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have seen that Socrates has a considered and distinctive conception τέχνη. We’ve also seen that a lot of Socrates’ epistemological reflections should be understood within the τέχνη-framework: knowledge of particular facts, which contemporary epistemology treats as the basic case, is often for Socrates the manifestation of expertise. And while there are in the early dialogues references to, or invocations of, knowledge that cannot be understood in terms of τέχνη, there is no sign of any organized or reflective Socratic view about whatever form or forms of knowledge might be at play there. But I wish now to emphasize the positive tendency on Socrates’ part to understand knowledge generally in terms of  specifically—I wish, that is, to urge the point that that the role of  in Socrates’ epistemological thought is such that we may say simply that, for Socrates, knowledge is . Whatever else knowledge is for Socrates, it is only secondarily or marginally or colloquially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, then, observe that seemingly more general epistemological questions are frequently interpreted or addressed in terms of , or by appeal to the case of . So, for example, Socrates’ attempt, in the , to demonstrate that  and ἐπιστήμη are ‘strong’&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:122&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:122&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;122&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; culminates, as we’ve seen, in the point that knowledge, being a τέχνη of measurement, will ensure that you get things right; Socrates’ discussion simply assumes that the resources of  may be deployed in resolving this question. The popular view had seemed initially to concern no more than the possibility of doing some particular thing that you know not to be the best thing to do. But Socrates treats the view of the many as a challenge to the value of knowledge taken as , or as a manifestation thereof. The obvious reason why he would so construe the popular view is that he thinks that knowing what is to be done in a particular instance must be a manifestation of the possession of some relevant .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, consider Socrates reply to Critias’ proposal in the  that temperance () is knowing oneself (τὸ γιγνώσκειν ἑαυτόν; 165a). Socrates says that if temperance is knowing (), then it must be some kind of ἐπιστήμη, and it must be &lt;em&gt;of&lt;/em&gt; something; his examples are medicine and housebuilding, which are ‘of’ health and building houses respectively—and these are, of course, paradigmatic . Some debate follows about what, if anything, knowledge must in fact be ‘of,’ but Socrates’ assumption that it will be some or other  and  remains in effect. It is notable how peculiar this transition would be except for the powerful force of  in Socrates’ epistemological thinking: Socrates supposes that self-knowledge could only be interpreted as some kind of τέχνη, despite the fact that there is obviously no τέχνη in the neighbourhood—as the rest of the dialogue makes clear enough—nor any evident reason to suppose right at the start that there should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That these transitions to  in the  and  are noteworthy is confirmed by an examination of the language employed. According to John Lyons’ analysis of Plato’s epistemological vocabulary, the verbs ‘,’ ‘,’ and ‘’ are grouped in the following way: ‘’ is largely interchangeably with either ‘’ or ‘,’ but ‘’ and ‘’ play somewhat different roles and are not interchangeable with each other.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:123&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:123&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;123&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; For example, ‘,’ unlike ‘,’ is particularly associated with personal nouns.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:124&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:124&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;124&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; ‘’ is in a “generator” for ‘τέχνη,’ in that when someone knows in the sense indicated by ‘,’ then you can invoke a corresponding τέχνη.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:125&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:125&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;125&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the , Socrates proceeds thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;εἰ γὰρ δὴ γιγνώσκειν γέ τί ἐστιν ἡ σωφροσύνη, δῆλον ὅτι ἐπιστήμη τις ἂν εἴη καὶ τινός: ἢ οὔ;—ἔστιν, ἔφη, ἑαυτοῦ γε.—οὐκοῦν καὶ ἰατρική, ἔφην, ἐπιστήμη ἐστὶν τοῦ ὑγιεινοῦ;—πάνυ γε.—εἰ τοίνυν με, ἔφην, ἔροιο σύ: “ἰατρικὴ ὑγιεινοῦ ἐπιστήμη οὖσα τί ἡμῖν χρησίμη ἐστὶν καὶ τί ἀπεργάζεται,” εἴποιμ᾽ ἂν ὅτι οὐ σμικρὰν ὠφελίαν: τὴν γὰρ ὑγίειαν καλὸν ἡμῖν ἔργον ἀπεργάζεται, εἰ ἀποδέχῃ τοῦτο.—ἀποδέχομαι.—καὶ εἰ τοίνυν με ἔροιο τὴν οἰκοδομικήν, ἐπιστήμην οὖσαν τοῦ οἰκοδομεῖν, τί φημι ἔργον ἀπεργάζεσθαι, εἴποιμ᾽ ἂν ὅτι οἰκήσεις: ὡσαύτως δὲ καὶ τῶν ἄλλων τεχνῶν.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:126&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:126&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;126&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we move from ‘’ to ‘τέχνη,’ but the example is not at odds with Lyons’ analysis. What we see here is an explicit &lt;em&gt;inference&lt;/em&gt; on Socrates’ part: we have a case of knowing something (γιγνώσκειν τί) and &lt;em&gt;therefore&lt;/em&gt; of ἐπιστήμη, and thus also of τέχνη. This case then shows that Socrates is prepared to infer a τέχνη not only where the sort of knowledge in question (knowing oneself) seems to have no evident connection with τέχνη, but also where the specific epistemic vocabulary has no particular connection with τέχνη in general Platonic usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the  we also have a transition from  to  by way of :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;καὶ δοκεῖ, ἔφη, ὥσπερ σὺ λέγεις, ὦ Σώκρατες, καὶ ἅμα, εἴπερ τῳ ἄλλῳ, αἰσχρόν ἐστι καὶ ἐμοὶ σοφίαν καὶ ἐπιστήμην μὴ οὐχὶ πάντων κράτιστον φάναι εἶναι τῶν ἀνθρωπείων πραγμάτων.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;οἶσθα οὖν ὅτι οἱ πολλοὶ τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἐμοί τε καὶ σοὶ οὐ πείθονται, ἀλλὰ πολλούς φασι γιγνώσκοντας τὰ βέλτιστα οὐκ ἐθέλειν πράττειν, ἐξὸν αὐτοῖς, ἀλλὰ ἄλλα πράττειν.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:127&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:127&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;127&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The popular view is assumed from the outset to be a rejection of the view of  and  shared by Protagoras and Socrates, and  turns out later to entail . There are in fact a number of instances of logical rather than liguistic transitions from  to ; Lyons himself discusses an case in the , where ‘’ is used in connection with ‘τέχνη’ not for linguistic reasons but as part of an argument connecting good judgment in a particular field with an appropriate τέχνη.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:128&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:128&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;128&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second, and related, observation is that Socrates tends either to subsume whatever one might know under some , or to disregard or dismiss such ‘knowledge’ altogether. Recall for instance that Socrates and Ion were said each to know () that Socrates has five fingers on a hand by the same , namely arithmetic (537e). Now one might think that knowing one has five fingers on a hand is pretty elementary—not the kind of thing one would need any  for at all. Socrates and Ion aren’t mathematicians; a child might know he has five fingers on a hand because he proudly counts them up every day, five being the highest number he can get to. Nevertheless, Socrates subsumes his and Ion’s knowledge under the arithmetical . The thought, as I understand it, is that to the extent you that there are five of something, that will be because to some degree or in form you possess the arithmetical  (recall that one may benefit from mathematical  without actually being a mathematician, as is the case with carpenters, and perhaps with all experts).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where there is no such  or no possession of such—where ‘knowledge’ could come in bits and pieces, or where a putative body of knowledge is in some other way incomplete or unsystematic—then Socrates isn’t interested. He doesn’t for example, concern himself with historical knowledge.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:129&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:129&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;129&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This can’t be attributed just to Socrates’ pursuit of wisdom, since that pursuit doesn’t prevent him from invoking other more ‘theoretical’ varieties of knowledge—like arithmetic—so long as these constitute .&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:130&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:130&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;130&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; That Socrates doesn’t discuss a given topic doesn’t show much on its own, of course, but we can look at what he say about poetry and oratory. Not only does Socrates not consider these to be τέχναι, he never considers the possibility that they might still involve impressive bodies of psychological or dramatic knowledge. Socrates is quite willing to grant that poets and orators may be, in some sense, extremely capable and successful, but so far as knowledge goes, the choices seem to be: τέχνη or nothing. We can see this at &lt;em&gt;Gorgias&lt;/em&gt; 464c–465a, where it’s clear that saying rhetoric (or here “flattery,” of which rhetoric is a sub-type) is not a τέχνη is equivalent to saying that it just guesses. And then there is the poor Ion, who for all his apparent gifts is reduced by Socrates to a conduit for the divine. Socrates’ view, it seems, is that if you have some kind of success, then it’s because of τέχνη, or else merely a result of guessing or divine inspiration or madness. In this respect Aristotle, who tabulates various forms of knowledge, is an obvious contrast.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:131&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:131&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;131&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Another interesting contrast is with Isocrates’s position in . Isocrates also argues that the ῥήτορες do not possess a , despite their invocation of such paradigmatic cases as knowing one’s letters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am amazed when I see these men claiming students for them­selves; they fail to notice that they are using an ordered art (τεταγμένη ) as a model for a creative activity (ποιητικόν πρᾶγμα).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:132&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:132&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;132&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He maintains nevertheless that there is a role for teaching in public speaking, though a much more modest one than would be indicated by claiming a , and his goal in the following passages is then to show that there is something to be taught here even though it doesn’t rise to level of —a task which he evidently doesn’t consider to be a totally trivial one. We do not find anything like this kind of proposal being offered by Socrates—quite the opposite.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:133&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:133&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;133&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, all of this fits with and accounts for the striking fact about the dialogues with which we began: as Callicles says, Socrates simply doesn’t let up on the -talk. In prompting Euthyphro to tell him what piety is, Socrates invokes the measure-weight-number triad which constitutes the definitive characteristic of technical precision. He thinks that the notion of  as self-knowledge may best be elucidated by comparison with carpentry and arithmetic. He thinks that the baker deserves scorn because he isn’t a doctor. He finds it astonishing that there is no equivalent of animal-husbandry for humans. If the standard to which Socrates holds claim to knowledge is the standard set by his conception of , then the simple and obvious explanation for this is the one I have proposed:  is what knowledge is for Socrates.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:6&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When I speak of a ‘Socratic conception of knowledge,’ I mean a conception of knowledge distinctive of the Socrates in the Platonic dialogues mentioned in n. [dialogues] above. I say ‘conception’ rather than ‘theory,’ because, first, we see Socrates deploying an understanding of knowledge rather than setting out an account of it, and, second, because Socrates expresses doubts (or serious puzzlement) about how to understand knowledge. Nor do I insist that these dialogues are perfectly consistent. On the other hand, I do mean to suggest more than merely that these dialogues manifest a conception of knowledge in the same way that everybody manifests some conception of knowledge. What Socrates says reflects deliberate consideration of the topic—of the formal features of , for example. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:6&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:8&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I won’t claim that Socrates’ conception of τέχνη (or of knowledge generally) is totally unique in the history of philosophy—his τέχνη-oriented approach to epistemology had a good deal of influence in the ancient world, not least in Plato’s case. But his conception of τέχνη is different enough from that of Plato, Aristotle, and various of his contemporaries, and in sufficiently significant ways (philosophically and interpretatively), that we need to consider it in its own right if we are to understand him correctly. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:8&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:10&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A few scholars have recently taken more of an interest in the Socratic conception of τέχνη in its own right, and as a matter of &lt;em&gt;epistemology&lt;/em&gt; rather than just ethics—most notably Paul &lt;a href=&quot;#woodruff1990pse&quot;&gt;Woodruff (1990)&lt;/a&gt; and Angela @asmith1998. A useful discussion with more attention to the contemporary views about τέχνη may be found in &lt;a href=&quot;#reeve1989sita&quot;&gt;Reeve (1989)&lt;/a&gt; [37–45], though Reeve’s discussion generally gives the (in my view mistaken) impression that there was a single going view of , albeit one which underwent some development. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:10&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;182d–e. Neither Laches nor Nicias actually uses the word ‘τέχνη’ when speaking of fighting in armour; rather they refer to it as a (possible)  (as here) or ἐπιστήμη. But ‘ἐπιστήμη,’ as noted, is a frequent synonym for ‘τέχνη’ in the early dialogues, and Socrates is treating ‘’ as implying a τέχνη at 185e, and when he begins speaking of ‘τέχνη’ back at 185a, Nicias assumes that the τέχνη in question would be fighting in armour (185c). &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:19&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:63&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At &lt;em&gt;Protagoras&lt;/em&gt; 344c–d, Socrates says misfortune () might incapacitate a craftsman but not an ordinary person (who has no τέχνη to start with). Here misfortune interferes with τέχνη, but by destroying it, not by preventing it from attaining its goals. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:63&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:64&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Wisdom makes men fortunate in every case [of τέχνη], since I don’t suppose that she would ever make any sort of mistake but must necessarily do right and be lucky—otherwise she would no longer be wisdom.” (trans. .) &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:64&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:65&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cf.  XIV: “that medicine has plentiful reasoning in itself to justify its treatment, and that it would rightly refuse to undertake obstinate cases, or under-taking them would do so without making a mistake [i.e. it succeeds in what it undertakes], is shown both by the present essay and by the expositions of those versed in the art.” &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:65&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:67&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As is the case throughout book I, but also elsewhere: for example at 428b–29a and 438c–e. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:67&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:70&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In a sense Socrates refutes the idea that knowledge is weak &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt;. If you think of knowledge in terms of knowing the right thing to do on a given occasion, then the refutation does consist in showing that akrasia is impossible. But if we think of knowledge in terms of τέχνη, then the refutation is completed only later with the τέχνη of measurement. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:70&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Thus Terence &lt;a href=&quot;#penner1997ssk&quot;&gt;Penner (1997)&lt;/a&gt; is right to insist that the “knowledge is strong” thesis is not implied by the denial of . The denial of  is rather required to ensure we do as knowledge directs. Knowledge is strong because it ensures that you &lt;em&gt;think the right way&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; the denial of  takes over. Cf. also &lt;a href=&quot;#allen1960sp&quot;&gt;Allen (1960)&lt;/a&gt;, pp. 257–8 and n. 6. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:73&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Among those he excludes are five of the six passages that &lt;a href=&quot;#vlastos1985sdk&quot;&gt;Vlastos (1985)&lt;/a&gt; [73] had offered as illustrating that “Socrates is himself convinced that he has found what he has been looking for: knowledge of moral truth.” The one he admits is 29b, which itself is more exhortation than substantive claim. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:98&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(I would say: Socrates has no craft—at least not of a moral sort—but this does not mean that he doesn’t know particular facts which would fall within the purview of some craft.) But this approach leads them to deny that, on the Socratic view, knowledge of definitions is necessary for knowledge of specific facts (p. 45). But you could perfectly well still say exactly that, once you have distinguished different forms of knowledge. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:103&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Benson p. 237. Though he speaks of understanding rather than τέχνη. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:104&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:105&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;#woodruff1990pse&quot;&gt;Woodruff (1990, p. 77)&lt;/a&gt; points out. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:105&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:106&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;See Brickhouse and Smith pp. 39–41 for some possibilities (including these two). &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:106&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:107&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For the same reason, Benson is wrong to suggest that expressions of knowledge which fall outside his expertise sense are “loose” or “in the manner of the vulgar” (pp. 236, 238). He worries about cases where disavowals of definitional knowledge are juxtaposed closely with avowals of non-expert knowledge. (He appears—from p. 236 with n. 34—to be thinking of &lt;em&gt;Apology&lt;/em&gt; 29a–b and 37b, and to a lesser extent of &lt;em&gt;Euthydemus&lt;/em&gt; 296e–297a and &lt;em&gt;Hippias Minor&lt;/em&gt; 304e.) He concludes that “we can either take these passages as evidence for another sense of knowledge that Socrates periodically makes use of—although not nearly so frequently as we have been led to suppose—or we can take them as misstatements made in the heat of the moment or in the manner of the vulgar. In either case the account of Socratic knowledge offered in this examination escapes unscathed” (p. 238). &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:107&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#woodruff1990pse&quot;&gt;Woodruff (1990, p. 77)&lt;/a&gt;. Benson, though treating Socratic knowledge as understanding rather than , also points out that any further conception of knowledge attributed to Socrates’ on the basis of apparently exception avowals of knowledge would have to be “characterized almost entirely in negative terms.” He rightly sees this a reason for discounting the epistemological significance of those avowals, [BUT STILL TOO WORRIED; p. 237]. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:113&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href=&quot;#robinson1950definition&quot;&gt;Robinson (1950)&lt;/a&gt; [pp. 113-14]: “If we describe [the What-is-X? question], as I have so far refrained from doing, by means of such words as ’definition’ and ’example,’ if we extract from it explicit rules and principles of definition, we pass to a stage of abstraction higher than the dialogues themselves display. We can, indeed, pick out an occasional word to be appropriately translated by ‘example’ or ‘definition,’ and we can easily formulate, from Socrates instructions to his hearers, rules resembling those in a modern textbook; but that is only to say that each level of abstraction is near to the next! The actual picture in the dialogues is not more but less abstract than the picture here given; for Socrates does not use the letter X; he never gives the function but one of it’s arguments.” &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:118&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:119&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Socrates is as happy with expressions of the form “know X” as “know what X is”—he thinks of knowledge as much in terms of acquaintance or perception as in terms of anything linguistic. See e.g. &lt;em&gt;Charmides&lt;/em&gt; 159a, &lt;em&gt;Euthyphro&lt;/em&gt; 6e, &lt;em&gt;Gorgias&lt;/em&gt; 503e. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:119&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:120&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;See, for example, &lt;em&gt;Laches&lt;/em&gt; 190a–c and &lt;em&gt;Gorgias&lt;/em&gt; 503d–e. Indeed a phrase like “knowing X” can simply be used synecdochally to characterize a τέχνη as a whole by reference to its proper object—thus medicine is the “knowledge of health,” or the “knowledge of health and disease” (e.g. &lt;em&gt;Charmides&lt;/em&gt; 165c, &lt;em&gt;Gorgias&lt;/em&gt; []). &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:120&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:121&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cf. &lt;em&gt;Euthyphro&lt;/em&gt; 6e, where piety is a  or model one may look to. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:121&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:122&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At 352b–d Socrates and Protagoras employ ‘ἐπιστήμη,’ ‘,’ ‘,’ and ‘.’ &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:122&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:123&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#lyons1972ssa&quot;&gt;Lyons (1972)&lt;/a&gt;, chapter 7. Lyons’ discussion concerns the Platonic corpus as a whole. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:123&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Lyons pp. 160 ff. &lt;em&gt;Charmides&lt;/em&gt; 159a may be an exception—Socrates observes that Charmides knows Greek, employing ‘,’ but, on the evidence of the &lt;em&gt;Protagoras&lt;/em&gt;, I don’t not think Socrates would speak of a τέχνη of Greek; Lyons’ conclusion is the same (pp. 184–5, 221). Also, it is natural—but noteworthy—that, given the close connection between  and τέχνη, Socrates never claims to know things in a propositional sense with , although he makes such avowals with . &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:125&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Cf. ([-&lt;a href=&quot;#allen1989dpe&quot;&gt;Allen (1989)&lt;/a&gt; p. 326]). &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:129&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:130&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Even Aristotle makes somewhat disparaging remarks about history, on account of its dealing only with particular facts: &lt;em&gt;Poetics&lt;/em&gt; 1451a36–b11. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:130&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:131&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For example at the start of &lt;em&gt;NE&lt;/em&gt; VI.3: “ἔστω δὴ οἷς ἀληθεύει ἡ ψυχὴ τῷ καταφάναι ἢ ἀποφάναι, πέντε τὸν ἀριθμόν: ταῦτα δ᾽ ἐστὶ τέχνη ἐπιστήμη φρόνησις σοφία νοῦς.” &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:131&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:132&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;12, trans. . &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:132&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:133&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It is sometimes claimed that Socrates (or Plato) was gesturing in some way towards a different model of knowledge. So for example &lt;a href=&quot;#roochnik1996aaw&quot;&gt;Roochnik (1996, p. 6)&lt;/a&gt; says that “Plato rejects techne as a model of moral knowledge,” and that he juxtaposes τέχνη and virtue precisely in order to show how poor a model τέχνη provides APPLIES TO SOCRATES?. BUT THAT’S WIERD. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:133&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
