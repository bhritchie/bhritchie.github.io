I was a PhD student in philosophy at Harvard, but then I dropped out. Now I work as a software developer at [a great tech startup](http://www.sandglaz.com/) in Toronto. I expect to be a billionaire any day now.

## Philosophy

I was fairly pleased with some of the work I did at Harvard. Hopefully I’ll get around to properly publishing a bit of it, but here are some of the highlights in the meantime. More to come.

Forgive formatting errors. I converted these papers from LaTeX to Markdown automatically, and I’m still cleaning them up.

- [Socrates’ Conception of Knowledge](/2014/11/15/socrates-conception-of-knowledge/)

> I articulate the Socratic understanding of *techne*---expertise---and argue that, for Socrates, *techne* is knowledge. This sheds light on various other aspects of Socrates’ philosophy.

- [Svataḥ Prāmāṇya in Kumārila Bhaṭṭa](/2014/11/19/svatah-pramanya-in-kumarila-bhatta/)

> I provide an interpretation of [Kumārila Bhaṭṭa](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kumaarila/)’s claim that beliefs are *svataḥ prāmāṇya* (approximately: ‘presumptively justified’).
