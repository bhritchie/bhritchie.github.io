I was a PhD student in philosophy at Harvard, but then I dropped out. Now I work as a software developer at [a great tech startup](http://www.sandglaz.com/) in Toronto. I expect to be a billionaire any day now.

## Philosophy

I was fairly pleased with some of the work I did at Harvard. Hopefully I'll get around to properly publishing some of it eventually, in the meantime I'm putting up some highlights here.

- [Kumarila on Epistemic Entitlement](/2014/11/19/kumarila-on-epistemic-entitlement/)
- [Socratesâ€™ Conception of Knowledge](/2014/11/15/socrates-conception-of-knowledge/)

Note: I converted these papers from LaTeX to Markdown with Pandoc, so although I'm trying to clean them up, there will be some formatting issues, especially with citations.
